# Overstimulation and Environmental Neurodiversity

> **Note**: This theme wove through multiple topics during the OGM 2025-11-06 call, particularly in [[Mike Nelson]]'s check-in and [[Scott Moehring]]'s [[Environmental Neurodiversity]] hypothesis.

## Mike Nelson's Overstimulation

Mike described feeling "completely, absolutely, intellectually, politically overstimulated" from:

### Sources
1. **TEDx Mid-Atlantic** - Powerful talks on Saturday
2. **Virginia Election Results** - Major political shifts
3. **Technology Developments** - IETF debates, digital identity, content scraping
4. **AI Bubble Concerns** - Daily Wall Street Journal articles
5. **General Change** - "There's so much going on"

### His Coping
- Long bike rides
- Semi-retirement allowing some breathing room
- Peak fall foliage appreciation

## Scott's Environmental Neurodiversity Hypothesis

The modern information environment has created a situation where:

**Previously**:
- Neurodiverse (ADD, autism) people: Needed special coping strategies
- Neurotypical people: Filters and strategies worked fine

**Now**:
- Many neurotypical people experiencing what neurodiverse people always have
- Information flood overwhelming typical filters
- Strategies developed by neurodiverse community now needed by everyone

**Key Quote**: "The strategies that are essential for one group might now be what's needed for another group."

## Connection to GABA

From [[Jerry Michalski]]'s discussion of [[GABA and Filtering]]:
- GABA as the brain's primary inhibitor
- Modern life as constant stimulation
- Filters working overtime
- Some people's baseline filters different (ADD/ADHD)
- Need for cognitive "breathing room"

## Scott's Personal Experience

"I feel everything everywhere all at once as just part of every day. Not to the extent of a psy trip, but much more than the people I hang out with."

## The Information Environment

Changes that created this:
- **Constant connectivity**
- **Multiple simultaneous channels**
- **Rapid context switching**
- **No boredom** (Scott: "We have killed boredom")
- **Always-on news cycles**
- **Social media streams**

## Implications

### Universal Need for Strategies
- Filtering techniques
- Attention management
- Recovery time
- Environmental control
- Organizational tools (like [[Tab Groups Discovery]])

### Reframe "Normal"
- What's "typical" is contextual
- Current environment is atypical
- We're all adapting to new conditions

### Value Neurodiverse Approaches
- [[Doug Breitbart]]'s [[Tab Groups Discovery]]
- Former Google CIO's ADHD-driven organization methods
- Other strategies born from necessity
