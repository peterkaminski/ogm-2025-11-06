Participant,Key OGM-y Topic & Insight
Scott Moehring,"The concept of Remixability – Inspired by Kevin MacLeod (a prolific composer of freely distributed music) , Scott is focusing on making his work (like his ""universals"" frameworks ) into ""ingredients or recipes"" that others can use to create their own things, rather than perfect, self-contained products."
Gil Friend,"Automated Transcript De-identification – Working on a technique called ""vibe coding"" for automatically scrubbing personally identifying information (PII) from transcripts of executive coaching conversations using custom bots on Delphi and one built with Alex."
Alex Kladitis,"AI Bias in News Reporting – Found that ChatGPT, when asked to summarize what Chinese papers are saying, inherently built in commentary or interpretation suggesting why the information might be ""wrong"" or not true , suggesting a subtle, in-built bias in the training data."
Pete Kaminski,"Agentic AI for Document Synthesis – Using agentic AI assistants (like Cloud Code and Droid) for complex software development and is exploring its use for working with large corpora of text (legal documents, research studies, serial fiction). He is developing a ""meta-collection"" of smashed-together frameworks called ""field of sheaves""."
David Witzel,"Growth in Living Systems vs. Economics – Thinking about how to integrate regenerative notions and living systems into his public policy and technocratic background. He is questioning how traditional economics' reliance on growth and what lessons can be drawn from biological systems, using the life and growth of a sourdough starter as a metaphor."
Klaus Mager,"Incentivizing Regenerative Agriculture – Focusing on a transition to action regarding climate warnings. His project with the Schumacher Institute is aimed at helping small-to-medium farmers get into wholesale markets and creating a secondary revenue stream for them by paying them for environmental services (e.g., soil health, cover crops)."
Jerry Michalski,"Non-Local Consciousness, GABA, and Psilocybin – Read Dan Brown's The Secret of Secrets which discusses non-local consciousness (the idea that consciousness is a universal background and the brain is a tuner) and GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), an inhibitor that filters the world's stimuli. This coincided with his first ""transformative"" psilocybin experience, which he felt lowered his filters to perceive what is already around him."
Mike Nelson,"Overstimulation and Political Shifts – Shared feeling completely overstimulated intellectually and politically , stemming from a TEDx Mid-Atlantic event and recent election results in Virginia. He also discussed tracking a lively debate at the IETF about a digital identity system and tools to prevent content scraping."
Victoria (Spain),"The Drop in Curiosity – Noted the dropping level of curiosity in the world. She is observing how people who willingly attend a workshop (interested in learning) fail to engage in community conversations, reflecting a lack of response to things meant to ""trigger conversations""."
Doug Breitbart,"Tab Groups as Tab Emancipation – Shared a personal, life-changing experience discovering and using the browser feature Tab Groups. As an ADD person whose executive function has matured , this tool allowed him to organize and close 250 tabs across multiple windows , relieving a sense of overwhelm."
