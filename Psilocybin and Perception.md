# Psilocybin and Perception

> **Note**: This topic arose from [[Jerry Michalski]]'s personal experience shared during his check-in on the OGM 2025-11-06 call, but was not a main discussion topic. This page provides context on the substance and its effects.

## What is Psilocybin?

**Psilocybin** is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound produced by certain mushroom species (often called "magic mushrooms" or "shrooms"). When ingested, it converts to psilocin, which affects serotonin receptors in the brain.

## Effects on Perception

### Traditional Understanding
Psychedelics were historically thought to create hallucinations - false perceptions generated by the brain.

### Filter Theory (discussed in the call)
An alternative perspective suggests psilocybin:
- **Reduces neural filtering** rather than creating false perceptions
- Lowers [[GABA and Filtering]] activity
- Allows perception of information normally filtered from conscious awareness
- Reveals what's "always happening around you" but usually screened out

## Jerry's Experience

Jerry shared his first psilocybin journey during the call:
- **First trip ever** - had never used any drugs before
- Felt connected to "mycelial networks of the world"
- Experienced "everything all at once-ish"
- Described as "phenomenal" and "really transformative"
- Safe setting with trustworthy friend
- Friend had grown the mushrooms and tested them

### Key Insight
The experience aligned with the filter reduction theory from Dan Brown's book he'd been reading, suggesting psychedelics lower filters to reveal existing reality rather than creating fictional experiences.

## Connection to Consciousness Theories

The filter reduction model connects to:
- [[Non-Local Consciousness]] - consciousness as universal field we tune into
- Brain as receiver/tuner rather than generator
- GABA as the primary filtering mechanism
- Psychedelics as temporary filter adjustment tools

## Current Research Context

Recent years have seen renewed scientific interest in psilocybin for:
- Treatment-resistant depression
- Anxiety in terminal illness patients
- PTSD therapy
- Addiction treatment
- Enhanced creativity and problem-solving

Research institutions including Johns Hopkins, Imperial College London, and others are conducting clinical trials.

## Safety Considerations

Jerry's experience highlighted important safety factors:
- **Set and setting** - comfortable, safe environment
- **Trusted guide** - experienced, trustworthy person present
- **Quality control** - knowing the source and potency
- **Mental preparation** - understanding what to expect
- **Integration** - processing the experience afterward

## Mycelial Networks

Jerry specifically mentioned feeling connected to "mycelial networks" - the underground fungal networks that:
- Connect trees and plants in forests
- Share nutrients and information
- Function as a kind of "wood wide web"
- Represent interconnected, distributed intelligence

This connection is particularly poetic as the psilocybin came from mushrooms (fruiting bodies of mycelial networks).
