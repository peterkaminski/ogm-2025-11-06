# Critical Thinking Frameworks

> **Note**: Implicit category from [[Stacey Druss]]'s [[Two Truths and a Lie]] approach discussed during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## Stacey's Framework

**Two Truths and a Lie**: Assume every story contains both truth and falsehood, always working to discern which is which.

## Why Frameworks Matter

In an age of:
- [[Information Overload]]
- Conflicting narratives
- [[AI Bias and Perspectives]]
- [[Seeking Certainty]]

Need tools to:
- Navigate complexity
- Maintain open mind
- Avoid both cynicism and gullibility
- Make progress despite uncertainty

## Other Implied Frameworks from the Call

**Nelson's Law**: Nothing improves unless it changes (but not every change is improvement)

**Environmental Neurodiversity**: Reframing overwhelm as environmental mismatch

**Remixability**: Optimizing for use over control

**Field of Sheaves**: Synthesizing across frameworks
