# Rick Botelho

## Participation

Rick was present on the call but chose to pass when it was time to check in.

### Check-In

When [[Jerry Michalski]] asked if Rick wanted to step in:

**Rick's Response**: "Yeah, I'll pass, Jerry. Go ahead."

### Chat Contribution

Shared a complex question and link about political strategy:

**Question**: "How might we move beyond from playing the defensive game of political whack-a-mole to launch the #C5FA trifecta offensive, increase voter turnout, flip the mid-terms & make Trump lame-duck president? How might we use H.E.N. to shine out the light of truth and illuminate the ego-shadows and dark sides of alt-right neo-terrorism and systemic psychopathy inducing Deranged Trump Mass Psychosis?"
