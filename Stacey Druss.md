## Key Insight: Two Truths and a Lie Approach to Certainty

Stacey shared her framework for dealing with uncertainty and maintaining an open mind.

### The Framework

**Approach**: "I think of every story as being... there's two truths and a lie in it."

**Process**:
- "Always trying to figure out which is the lie"
- "Helps me to keep an open mind"
- "A constant process of, well, it could be that, or it could be this"
- "That's how I keep going every step of the way"

### Context

**Responding to**: [[Victoria (Spain)]]'s discussion about how people seek certainty

**Permission**: Asked [[Jerry Michalski]] if she could "use my check-in to answer Victoria" since she hadn't checked in yet and Victoria was leaving at the top of the hour. Jerry agreed.

**Clarity**: "I'm really clear on how I do it" (approach to certainty)

### Other References

**Previous Call**: [[Pete Kaminski]] mentioned that Stacey had shared something about "people in her building working together" creating a "little society that protects itself from outsiders"
- This sparked Pete's thinking about broken windows theory
- Led to one of his [[Field of Sheaves]] synthesis projects

**Reminder Issues**: Mentioned during pre-call that she searched and didn't get the meeting reminder at all
