> **Note**: "Friend of OGM's" who introduced [[Jerry Michalski]] to [[Non-Local Consciousness]] concept ~1.5 years before the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## The Key Idea

Suggested to Jerry: **What if consciousness isn't generated by neurons, but is background radiation of the universe?**

## Full Concept

"What if consciousness isn't a thing that materializes out of neurons in our heads when we have some kind of funny critical mass of neurons and activity? But what if consciousness is the background radiation of the universe, and we occupy it?"

"We sort of snap in, we tune into it, like a radio station, and then when we die, we sort of leave it, or meld back into it"

## Impact on Jerry

"Really sort of changed the way I look at things"

This idea later resonated with Dan Brown's "The Secret of Secrets" and Jerry's psilocybin experience.

## Connection to OGM

Mentioned as "friend of OGM's," suggesting active participation in the community at some point, though not present on this particular call.
