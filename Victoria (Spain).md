## Key Insight: The Drop in Curiosity

Victoria is observing a concerning decline in curiosity levels, even among people who willingly attend learning workshops.

### Main Observation

**Context**: Designing courses for companies, leading workshops

**Pattern**: People who:
- Willingly attend workshops
- Say they are interested in learning
- Yet when she posts questions or conversation triggers in the community
- **Nobody responds**

**Conclusion**: "How curiosity is dropping in our world"

**Impact**: She's "taking notes about and trying to understand" this phenomenon

### Other Activities

- Writing a novel
- Researching "how people seek certainty"
- Had a workshop session to attend (had to leave call early)

### Chat Contributions

**Látigo Discussion**: Early in call, mentioned something related to which hand held the "látigo" (whip in Spanish) - apologized for not knowing the English word

**Leaving Early**: "Now that we reach the transition, I'll take the opportunity to go ;)"

## The Curiosity Conversation

Victoria's observation sparked a rich discussion in the chat:

### Scott Moehring's Response

"I was thinking about your comment about the loss of curiosity. I'm wondering how much is a loss of available attention? I am a highly curious person, and yet I'm engaging less because I have less available attention. We have killed boredom with the constant stream of information everywhere, and I think one symptom shows up as a loss of curiosity."

### Pete Kaminski's Response

"A great conversation. I'm a very curious person by nature, and observationally, I see a lot of people who are incurious. I'm torn between whether it's a typical human development as people grow up, or our educational system that trains passion and agency out of people, or sort of a social contagion to be incurious as a way to deal with too much future."

**AI Observation**: "The place I see the curious/incurious split happen is when someone plays with an AI. Curious people use it quickly as a bicycle (or jet plane) for the mind; incurious people do the equivalent of trying to use the bicycle as a hammer or a chair, and discard it as terrible at the small uses they can think of."

### Jerry Michalski's Response

"I think the latter" (referring to Pete's theories)

"I blame the consumerization of our world, which dumbs us down"
