## What This Is

A comprehensive wiki documenting the OGM (Open Global Mind) community call from **Thursday, November 6, 2025**.

**90 interlinked pages** covering:
- 13 participant check-ins and contributions
- Chat conversation threads
- Background on every topic, person, book, and organization mentioned
- Connections between ideas and themes

## Source Materials

Located in `sources/`:
- **Zoom transcript**: Full closed caption transcript (~38,085 tokens!)
- **Chat log**: Complete Zoom chat with links and threaded conversations
- **Gemini takes**: Initial AI-generated participant insights (CSV and MD format)

## How It Was Created

Built using **[[Claude Code]]** (Anthropic's agentic AI assistant) on the same day as the call through:
- Reading and analyzing the full transcript and chat
- Identifying all participants, topics, and entities
- Creating participant pages with expanded context beyond initial analysis
- Extracting and organizing chat conversation threads
- Building background pages for every mentioned concept
- Creating comprehensive cross-references

See **[[Work Log]]** for complete meta-documentation of the creation process.

## Structure

### Core Pages

**[[README]]** - Home page with quick navigation

**[[Concept Index]]** - All 90 pages organized by category

**[[Work Log]]** - Meta-documentation of wiki creation

### Content Pages

**Participants** (13 pages):
Each participant has a dedicated page with their check-in, chat contributions, and connections to themes.

**Chat Threads** (4 pages):
Major conversation threads from the chat, synthesized with all contributors.

**Themes & Concepts** (60+ pages):
Background and context on every significant topic mentioned, from AI bias to sourdough metaphors.

**Reference** (3 index pages):
- [[Books and Publications]] - Every work, article, and link mentioned
- [[People Referenced]] - Non-participants mentioned during the call
- [[Organizations and Initiatives]] - Companies, institutions, and projects

## Navigation

### Wiki Links
Uses `[[Double Square Bracket Links]]` throughout:
- Click any `[[Link]]` to jump to that page
- Every page links back to README
- Related concepts sections on each page
- Extensive cross-referencing

### Browsing Strategies

**By Participant**: Start with someone's page, follow their concepts

**By Theme**: Use [[Concept Index]] categories or Major Themes from [[README]]

**By Interest**: Search for a topic, follow related links

**By Chat**: Read synthesized [[Chat Thread - Curiosity Decline]] or other threads

**Follow Connections**: Let links guide you through related ideas

## File Naming Convention

Files use **human-readable names** with proper capitalization and spaces:
- `Scott Moehring.md` (not `scott-moehring.md`)
- `AI Financial Bubble.md` (not `ai-financial-bubble.md`)
- `GABA and Filtering.md` (preserves acronym capitalization)

This makes files easy to find, read, and reference.

## Page Types

### Full Call Topics
Pages about topics that were main check-ins or major discussions. These have extensive detail from the call itself.

### Background Pages
Pages about topics mentioned but not deeply discussed. These include:

> **Note**: This topic was mentioned during the OGM 2025-11-06 call [context], but was not a main focus of discussion. This page provides background on the concept.

Then useful information about the topic and how it connected to the call.

### Reference Pages
Index pages organizing books, people, or organizations for easy lookup.

### Meta Pages
Pages about the wiki itself: [[Work Log]], [[Details About This Wiki]], [[Concept Index]]

## Key Features

### Comprehensive Coverage

- Background on all concepts

### Rich Interlinking

- Multiple paths to discover same content
- "See Also" sections

### Preserves Context
- Direct quotes from participants
- Timestamps noted (where relevant)
- Chat contributions included
- Connections between ideas explicit

### Both Breadth and Depth

## How to Use This Wiki

### First Time Visitors

1. Read **[[README]]** for overview and highlights
2. Browse **[[Concept Index]]** to see scope
3. Pick a participant or topic that interests you
4. Follow `[[Links]]` as curiosity leads

### Looking for Something Specific

- Use your editor's file search or grep
- Check **[[Concept Index]]** categories
- Look at reference pages: [[Books and Publications]], [[People Referenced]], [[Organizations and Initiatives]]

### Understanding the Call

- Read participant pages in order of check-ins
- Read [[Chat Thread - Curiosity Decline]] for the richest discussion
- See Major Themes in [[README]] for topic overview

### Following a Theme

Example: To understand the **consciousness discussions**:
1. Start with [[Jerry Michalski]]
2. Read [[Non-Local Consciousness]]
3. Follow to [[GABA and Filtering]]
4. Then [[Psilocybin and Perception]]
5. Explore [[Noetic Science]]
6. See how [[Sunil Malhotra]] and [[Dan Brown]] connect

### Exploring Connections

Example: **Environmental Neurodiversity** theme:
1. [[Doug Breitbart]] → [[Tab Groups Discovery]] → [[Executive Function and ADD]]
2. [[Scott Moehring]] → [[Environmental Neurodiversity]] → [[Curiosity and Attention]]
3. [[Mike Nelson]] → [[Overstimulation and Environmental Neurodiversity]] → [[Information Overload]]
4. See how they all connect!

## Tools That Work Well

### Obsidian
- Native `[[wikilink]]` support
- Graph view shows connections
- Backlinks panel
- Quick switcher for navigation

### Foam (VS Code)
- Wikilink support in VS Code
- Graph visualization
- Note creation

### Logseq / Roam
- Can import markdown
- Bidirectional linking
- Knowledge graph

### Plain Text Editor
- Works fine! Just search for `[[` to find links
- Grep for topics across files
- Manual but functional

## Extending This Wiki

### Adding Content

To add new pages:
1. Create `Page Name.md` file (proper capitalization, spaces OK)
2. Add disclaimers if not from call
3. Use `[[Links]]` to connect
4. Add back link to [[README]]
5. Update [[Concept Index]] if major addition

### Connecting to Future Calls

This could be a template for future OGM call documentation:
- Same structure
- Same file naming
- Cross-reference between call wikis
- Build OGM knowledge base over time

### Potential Additions

- Timestamp references into transcript
- Audio/video links if recorded
- Action items or follow-ups
- Connection maps between calls
- Theme tracking over time

## About the OGM Call Format

**First-Thursday Check-ins**: Special format used on this call
- Each person checks in once (no conversation between)
- Silence and empty space encouraged
- Raise hand or step in when moved
- Switch to conversation mode after all check-ins

**Jerry's facilitation**: Creates safe, contemplative space

**The OGM Community**: "Open Global Mind" - group exploring collective intelligence, systems thinking, and transformation

See [[OGM as Connector]] for Doug's reflection on Jerry's role.
