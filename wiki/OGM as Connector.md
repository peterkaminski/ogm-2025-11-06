# OGM as Connector

> **Note**: Theme mentioned by [[Doug Breitbart]] during his check-in about projects coalescing through OGM connections.

## Doug's Observation

Working on about 12 projects:
- **60% have OGM in common**
- Two independent projects connect
- They start talking
- Doug sees how they complement
- They fit into larger context

## The Pattern

**Jerry as "Energetic Center of Gravity"**:
- People meet through OGM
- Projects cross-pollinate
- Connections made
- Larger patterns emerge
- Things become "coalesceable"

## Hat Tip to Jerry

Doug thanked Jerry "for being the energetic center of gravity out of which a lot of these things, for me, were connected with and met, and now coalesceable in some fashion"

## How It Works

**Not forced collaboration**, but:
- Organic meetings
- Shared context
- Natural synergies
- Awareness of connections
- Ability to see larger wholes

## The Meta-Pattern

OGM creates conditions for:
- Serendipitous connections
- Pattern recognition
- Cross-project learning
- Emergent collaboration
- Larger meaning-making
