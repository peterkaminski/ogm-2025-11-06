# Noetic Science

> **Note**: Referenced by [[Jerry Michalski]] during his discussion of [[Non-Local Consciousness]] on the OGM 2025-11-06 call as "woo-woo noetic science territory, which I'm beginning to respect a lot more."

## What is Noetic Science?

**Noetic Sciences** is an interdisciplinary field exploring consciousness, human potential, and the relationship between mind and matter. The term comes from the Greek "noesis" (inner knowing or intuitive consciousness).

## Key Areas

- Consciousness studies
- Meditation and contemplative practices
- Exceptional human experiences
- Mind-body connection
- Parapsychology and psi phenomena
- Integral approaches to knowing

## Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS)

Founded in 1973 by Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell after his profound experience viewing Earth from space, recognizing consciousness as fundamental.

## Connection to the Call

Jerry's evolving view of the field in relation to:
- [[Non-Local Consciousness]] theories
- Dan Brown's treatment in "The Secret of Secrets"
- His own [[Psilocybin and Perception]] experience
- Mainstream vs "woo-woo" perspectives

## The "Woo-Woo" Label

Jerry acknowledged the field's reputation as "woo-woo" (dismissive term for beliefs considered mystical or unscientific) but noted he's "beginning to respect a lot more."

This reflects:
- Growing scientific interest in consciousness
- Personal experiences validating non-materialist views
- Integration of mystical and scientific perspectives
