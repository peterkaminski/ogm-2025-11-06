## Key Insight: Growth in Living Systems vs. Economics

David is exploring how to integrate regenerative and living systems thinking into traditional technocratic public policy frameworks, with "growth" as a key bridging concept.

### Core Question

How to integrate:
- **Regenerative notions** (developed over last few years, emerging in many spaces)
- **Technocratic public policy background** (his professional foundation)

### The Growth Framework

**Problem in Public Policy**:
- Doesn't focus on living systems
- May talk about "systems" but not often
- Focuses on "optimization and efficiency"
- These become "proxies for something good"
- Result: "tend to get trapped into making things a little bit better"
- Rarely achieve "positive sum outcome abundance kind of notions"

**Economics and Growth**:

Traditional economics relies heavily on growth:
1. **Poverty Solution**: "How do you get rid of poverty? Well, you grow."
2. **Stability**: "Economies tend to be robust while they're growing, they tend to get very fragile while they're not."

**Living Systems and Growth**:
- "Living systems are kind of critical. Growth matters a ton to living systems."

### Central Inquiry

"What are the kinds of growth and the perspectives on growth that would inform traditional economics in a more of a living systems way?"

"Are there examples, basically metaphors, that we can take from biological systems around growth that would inform traditional economics in new ways?"

### Sourdough Metaphor

**Inspiration**: Someone's Stanford application essay about the history of sourdough

**The Story**:
- Pioneers crossing the country kept sourdough starters alive
- Women pioneers kept sourdough next to their breasts to keep it warm crossing mountains
- The sourdough being alive
- The growth of sourdough as a metaphor

**Status**: "That's as far as I've got" - needs to explore further with AI

### On Economics

**Nuanced View**: "A lot of people kind of want to just throw it away and say economists are fools... they're funny, I like to make fun of them, so... but there's a lot of wisdom in economics, too."

**Proposal**: "We should think of it as Indigenous knowledge, probably"

**Goal**: Not to discard economics but to retrofit regenerative thinking into "our own borrowed old framings"
