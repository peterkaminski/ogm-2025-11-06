# Agentic AI and Document Synthesis

> **Note**: This was [[Pete Kaminski]]'s main check-in topic during the OGM 2025-11-06 call. This page provides context on what agentic AI is and its applications.

## What is Agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems that can:
- Act autonomously toward goals
- Break down complex tasks into subtasks
- Create and manage their own to-do lists
- Read and write multiple files
- Work through problems systematically

Pete describes it as working "about at the level of a human software developer."

## Key Difference from Simple LLMs

**Simple LLM Chat**:
- Single request → single response
- No task breakdown
- No file management
- No persistent workflow

**Agentic AI**:
- Can be told: "Fix this bug" or "Build this feature"
- Creates own task list
- Works through tasks one by one
- Checks items off
- Reads/writes many files as needed
- More autonomous and self-directed

## Tools Discussed

### Claude Code
- Made by Anthropic
- Terminal version (for developers)
- Web version (more accessible, works on mobile)
- Pete has been using for 6-8+ months
- $250 credit promotion mentioned (expires Nov 18, 2025)

### Droid
- Made by Factory Eye
- Also has web version
- Another major player in the space

## Applications

### Software Development (Pete's primary use)
- Complex, multi-file codebases
- Bug fixes
- Feature implementation
- Refactoring

### Document Synthesis
Pete's emerging interest - applying same approach to:

**Legal Documents**:
- Large document sets
- Documents that need to fit together
- Analysis across multiple contracts
- Rewriting with consistency

**Research Studies**:
- Analyzing large corpora
- Synthesizing findings
- Creating overviews

**Serial Fiction**:
- Understanding large story arcs
- Writing new episodes consistent with canon
- Planning new volumes in a series
- Maintaining character consistency

**Framework Synthesis** (see [[Field of Sheaves]]):
- Smashing together related frameworks
- Creating 10-20 page overviews
- Connecting ideas across domains

## Pete's Vision

"Everybody's gonna be doing this kind of stuff in 18 months, 24 months."

Currently: "You could be doing it today" but with challenges.

## Challenges to Adoption

### For Non-Technical Users

**Pete's "Oven Mitts" Observation**:
Watching someone use these tools, "it was kind of like they had oven mitts on, and they were trying to do fine-grained tasks"

**Why It's Hard**:
- Built by software developers for software developers
- High initial overhead
- Feels like "molasses" even with easier web versions
- Still requires some technical comfort

### The Gap
- "Not quite ready for mass adoption"
- "Easier on-ramp" but still challenging
- Web version paradoxically harder than terminal in some ways

## Pete's Offer

"I would love to show some people how to do that more."

Seeking collaborators interested in exploring these tools for non-code applications.

## The "Field of Sheaves" Project

Pete's specific application: Creating a "meta-collection" of smashed-together frameworks called [[Field of Sheaves]].

Examples created:
- Collective efficacy
- Social cyclic theories
- Intention-action gap
- Strategy and management frameworks
- Government governance principles
- Commons stewardship by communities

## Status: Between Amazing and Embarrassing

Pete's ambivalence:
- "Half amazing" - successfully synthesizing complex knowledge
- "Half embarrassing" - "mostly built by AI"
- Too embarrassed to release publicly yet
- Working on framing what's good vs problematic

## Broader Implications

### For Knowledge Work
- Massive increase in synthesis capacity
- AI as thought partner, not just tool
- Human becomes curator/director

### For Expertise
- Changes what expertise means
- Shifts toward orchestration and judgment
- Questions of attribution and authorship

### For Collaboration
- New ways to work with large bodies of text
- Team members can leverage huge resources
- Democratization of certain types of analysis
