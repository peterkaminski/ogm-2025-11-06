## Key Insight: Overstimulation and Political Shifts

Mike shared feeling "completely, absolutely, intellectually, politically overstimulated" from multiple sources of input and change.

### Background

**Never Done Drugs**: Shared with [[Jerry Michalski]] that he's never done any drugs, not even cigarettes - "did a total bypass past adolescence"

**Security Clearance Story**: When joining Clinton administration (Jan 1993):
- Interviewers refused to believe he'd never done drugs
- Every other person they interviewed had done drugs in college
- Several were still using and needed withdrawal plans
- Mike had two random drug tests in the next 10 days
- Eventually believed when they talked to people who'd worked with him

### Sources of Overstimulation

#### 1. TEDx Mid-Atlantic (Saturday before call)

**Powerful Talks**:
- Joe Trippi
- Michael McFaul (former ambassador to Russia)
- DC rapper who "reinvented the business model"
  - Left major studio and touring
  - Started "Front Porch" - performs on his front porch for neighborhood
  - Less lucrative but less exhausting

#### 2. Virginia Election Results (Previous 3 Days)

**Major Democratic Wins**:
- [[Abigail Spanberger]] elected governor
  - Mike knows her personally for ~6 years
  - Close with one of their best friends
  - "A moral, decent, smart, kind person... and a young person"
- Won governorship, lieutenant governor, AND Attorney General
  - "Incredibly important given all the lawsuits we're going to have to file against the Trump administration"
- Legislature: went from 1-person majority to 14-seat majority (~52% to 61%)
- Virginia has term limits: one 4-year term for governor
  - Creates focus on "building talent" and "several choices"

**National Pattern**: "Around the country, we had other very impressive landslide victories"

**Interpretation**: "People are fed up with what Mr. Trump has been doing"
- Some also fed up with Democrats
- But "Democrats are unable to get organized, and therefore unable to do as much damage as Trump and his minions"

#### 3. Technology Developments

**Digital Identity Systems**:
- Chinese pushing forward a system
- Trying to get multinationals to use it
- "Clearly going to have surveillance built in"
- Can't go anonymously from service to service

**IETF Debates** (Internet Engineering Task Force meeting that week):

*Authentication System*:
- New system for digital transactions
- Lively debate

*Content Scraping Tool*:
- Allow websites to prevent scraping
- Question: Can McDonald's prevent Burger King from seeing prices?
- Bots scraping for social security numbers create huge demand on sites
- Dilemma: "How do you stop a bad person from abusing the openness of the internet while allowing a researcher to span 100,000 websites and search through terabytes of data?"

**Below the Radar**: "We're all fixated on whether AI will destroy world civilization" while these important discussions happen

### AI Bubble Concerns

**Wall Street Journal**: "Every day for the last 3 weeks, there's been at least one article along the lines of, oh my god, it's an AI bubble!"

**His Analysis**:
- "Clear to me for at least 2 years that we're on this track"
- "OpenAI is the AOL of our day"
- Completely overinflated stock price
- Altman doing "exactly the right thing" using it to make deals
- Deals "going to not look very good in a year or two"

**Three Bubbles**:
1. Cloud computing
2. AI chips
3. Cryptocurrency

**The Economy is AI**: WSJ article claimed all U.S. economic growth for 12+ months is from data center investment - "if you just take that out, the economy's been flat"

**Personal Stakes**:
- Employee #130 at [[Cloudflare]] before IPO
- Good chunk of retirement in Cloudflare stock
- Also IBM and other tech stocks
- "I tend to invest in what I know"

**The Questions**:
1. Will it drag down just AI companies, tech sector, or entire market?
2. How many are thinking of pulling out profits?
3. "What in the hell do you put the proceeds into?"
4. "Gold is up by a factor of 3" - others confused too

### Nelson's Law

**Nelson's Law of Life**: "Nothing improves unless it changes."

**Murphy's Corollary to Nelson's Law**: "Not every change is an improvement."

### Other Observations

**Dealing with Overstimulation**: "I usually do that by going for long bike rides"

**Weather**: "More than a week of spectacular weather. Peak, peak, peak fall foliage here in Washington."

**Semi-Retired**: "Being semi-retired, I can enjoy that"

**Optimism**: Despite everything, ended "somewhat optimistic" - "I'm gonna try to help push people in the direction of improvement"
