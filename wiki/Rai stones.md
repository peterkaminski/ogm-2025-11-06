# Rai Stones

> **Note**: Referenced by [[Jerry Michalski]] in chat as humorous alternative investment during [[AI Financial Bubble]] discussion.

## What are Rai Stones?

Large stone discs used as currency on the Island of Yap (Micronesia):
- Some up to 12 feet in diameter
- Made from limestone
- Too large to move, so ownership tracked socially
- Value based on size, craftsmanship, history

## In the Discussion

Jerry suggested: "Try rai stones" and "Roll it around the living room as your asset"

Humorous response to Mike's question about where to put money if tech bubble bursts.

## The Joke

Like gold or Bitcoin, but even more impractical as actual currency - highlighting absurdity of flight to safety assets.
