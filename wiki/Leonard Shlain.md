# Leonard Shlain

> **Note**: Author mentioned by [[Jerry Michalski]] as providing academic parallel to Dan Brown's Divine Feminine thesis during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## Key Work

**"The Alphabet vs. the Goddess"** - Academic treatment of the marginalization of the Divine Feminine

## The Thesis

Same core idea as Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code, but from academic perspective:
- Written language's impact on consciousness
- Marginalization of feminine principles
- Historical suppression of goddess worship
- Connection between literacy and patriarchy

## Jerry's Synthesis

All clicked together for Jerry:
1. Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code (popular fiction)
2. Leonard Shlain's academic work (same thesis)
3. Jerry's own decades of work on "consumer" concept
4. Yin and yang thinking
5. Non-local consciousness (later addition)

"All three stories kind of clicked in my head in a really wonderful way"
