# Two Truths and a Lie

> **Note**: [[Stacey Druss]]'s framework for dealing with uncertainty and seeking certainty shared during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## The Framework

**"I think of every story as being... there's two truths and a lie in it"**

## The Process

- "Always trying to figure out which is the lie"
- "Helps me to keep an open mind"
- "A constant process of, well, it could be that, or it could be this"
- "That's how I keep going every step of the way"

## Why It Works

**Assumes**:
- Not everything is false
- Not everything is true
- Truth is mixed with falsehood

**Enables**:
- Critical thinking without cynicism
- Open mind without gullibility
- Ongoing inquiry
- Flexible perspective

## Stacey's Clarity

"I'm really clear on how I do it" - this is a well-practiced approach for her

## Application

Rather than:
- Accepting everything
- Rejecting everything
- Getting stuck

Constantly asking:
- What's true here?
- What might be false?
- How can I tell the difference?
