# Panoptica and Narrative Tracking

> **Note**: [[Ben Hunt]]'s new project mentioned by [[Gil Friend]] during the OGM 2025-11-06 call. This page covers the concept and tool.

## What is Panoptica.ai?

New site by [[Ben Hunt]] and [[Rusty Gwynn]] for tracking global narratives

## How It Works

- **AI scanning** of ~8,000 sites worldwide
- Regular, ongoing basis
- **Distills trends** in conversations
- **Multi-colored graphs** showing rise and fall
- Topics tracked: bubbles, recession, interest rates, etc.

## The Concept

Provides a "meta-view on the stories that power the world"

Understanding which narratives are gaining/losing traction globally

## Content

- Wealth of articles and analysis
- Much of it "very OGM-y" according to Gil
- Worth exploring for OGM community

## Related: Epsilon Theory

Ben Hunt's earlier project, newsletter focused on narrative analysis and market psychology

## Comparison

Similar concept to [[Marshall Kirkpatrick]]'s work, but:
- Panoptica: Broader global narratives
- Marshall: Focused on sustainability/regeneration

## Why It Matters

**Narratives drive**:
- Markets
- Policy
- Public opinion
- Investment decisions
- Social movements

Understanding narrative trends = understanding what's coming

## Assessment

Gil found it "fascinating" and relevant to OGM interests in systems thinking and cultural patterns.
