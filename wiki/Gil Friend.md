# Gil Friend

Full name: **Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach**

## Key Insight: Automated Transcript De-identification

Gil's main check-in topic was developing a "vibe coding" technique for automatically scrubbing personally identifying information (PII) from transcripts.

### Main Points

**Context**: Working as an executive coach for CXOs and founders of purpose-driven companies.

**Problem**: Needs to de-identify coaching conversation transcripts before feeding them into AI bots for analysis.

**Solution Development**:
- Previously used manual global search and replace
- Built two custom bots:
  1. One on Delphi
  2. One custom-built with [[Alex Kladitis]] (more sophisticated)
- Claude Code helped build a drag-and-drop tool
- Finished configuring it, testing with clients

**Personal Journey**: This represents Gil's "first re-entry into the world of coding in, like, 100 years" - finding it "remarkable what's possible" with modern tools.
