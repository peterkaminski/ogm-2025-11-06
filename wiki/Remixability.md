# Remixability

The concept of creating work that others can use as ingredients to create their own things, rather than creating finished, self-contained products.

## Origin in This Discussion

Presented by: [[Scott Moehring]]

Inspired by: [[Kevin MacLeod]] - "the most prolific composer you've never heard of"

## Kevin MacLeod's Model

- Created 2,000 pieces of royalty-free music
- Released under Creative Commons
- One song: 31.6 billion plays
- Used in countless TikTok videos, Facebook Reels, etc.
- Website: http://royaltyfreedoc.com/

## Core Concept

### Instead of:
"Perfect, self-contained" products that are "never to be taken apart" and don't get "a life of its own"

### Create:
- **Ingredients** or **recipes**
- Things other people "can and want to use"
- Things that enable others to "create things that are theirs"
- Work that has "a life of its own through interactions with other people"

## Scott's Application

**The Universals Frameworks**:
- Turned into a deck format
- Made modular and movable
- Can recombine pieces
- "Changed it for me"
- "Hope that it's going to make it actually more usable for other people"

## Related Philosophy

[[Gil Friend]] connected this to the quote: "It's amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit"

Gil's reflection: "Revolutionary Legos" - building pieces that self-propagate rather than complete strategies, feeding the development of multiple strategies around the world.

## Connection to Other Themes

### Curiosity and Attention

Scott noted in chat: Curiosity may be declining not from lack of interest but from **lack of available attention**:

"I am a highly curious person, and yet I'm engaging less because I have less available attention. We have killed boredom with the constant stream of information everywhere, and I think one symptom shows up as a loss of curiosity."

**Implication**: Remixable, modular tools may help reduce cognitive load and enable creativity despite attention constraints.

### Environmental Neurodiversity

Scott's hypothesis: People with ADD/autism have developed "robust techniques to filter and focus" that may now be needed by neurotypical people overwhelmed by information flood.

**Connection**: Remixable tools may be part of the coping strategies needed.

## Contrast with Traditional Models

Traditional creative/business model:
- Create complete, polished works
- Maintain control and attribution
- Finished products

Remixability model:
- Create components and building blocks
- Release control, enable adaptation
- Seeds for others' creations
- Focus on use value over attribution

## Examples Beyond Music

- [[Pete Kaminski]]'s [[Field of Sheaves]] - smashing together frameworks
- Open source software
- Creative Commons content
- Modular frameworks and toolkits
- Educational resources designed for adaptation

## Philosophical Implications

**Question**: What changes when we optimize for:
- **Remixability** over completeness?
- **Usefulness** over credit?
- **Ingredients** over meals?
- **Seeds** over gardens?

**Value Shift**: From controlling complete works to enabling others' creativity
