# Tab Groups Discovery

> **Note**: This was [[Doug Breitbart]]'s main check-in topic during the OGM 2025-11-06 call, describing it as "life-changing." This page provides context on the feature and its impact.

## What are Tab Groups?

**Tab Groups** are a browser feature (available in Chrome, Edge, and other browsers) that allows users to:
- Organize tabs into named collections
- Collapse/expand groups
- Color-code groups
- Save groups for later
- Close groups without losing them
- Free up memory while maintaining organization

## Doug's Situation Before

### The Overwhelm
- **4-5 browser windows** across 3 monitors
- **45-50 tabs per window**
- **Total: ~250 tabs**
- Tabs so small they couldn't be differentiated
- "Emotionally, they're there. They exist."
- Morning routine: "Overwhelming crap. Like, what do I do now?"

### The Computer Impact
- "My poor little laptop that could"
- Asking "mini-computer demands" of it
- Resources exhausted
- Performance degraded

### The Psychological Weight
Tabs represented things he "didn't want to lose" but couldn't actually find or use effectively.

## The Discovery Moment

**Context**: At 69 years old, Doug's executive function as an ADD person had "finally fully matured"

**The Process**:
1. Saw something flash about browser functionality
2. Noticed "Tab Groups" in a menu
3. "Okay, I think this is my path to emancipation, to tab emancipation"
4. Because of newly vested executive function, "able to learn it and master it very, very quickly"

## The Transformation

### What Doug Did
1. Sorted and bucketed 250 tabs into groups
2. Closed those groups
3. Closed the browser windows
4. Freed up computer resources
5. Now only keeps 1-2 relevant tab groups open at a time

### The Impact
**"This is life-changing for someone like me"**

- Computer functioned again
- Things started to flow
- Could actually work
- Not in constant overwhelm
- Only relevant tabs visible

## Zooming Out: The Bigger Picture

Doug connected this personal discovery to his core philosophy:

### Core Belief
"Every human being has value to add and contribute"

### Key Question
"What do each one of those individuals need in order to be enabled to contribute?"

### Third Question
"How do we meet everyone's needs?"

### Tab Groups as Example
Doug found what **he** needed to be enabled to contribute - and it unleashed:
- "Flood tide of capacity"
- Organization
- Moving into action
- "Unleashing the hounds in all sorts of ways"

## Connection to Environmental Neurodiversity

This discovery exemplifies [[Scott Moehring]]'s [[Environmental Neurodiversity]] hypothesis:

- **Neurodiverse people** develop robust coping strategies
- **Strategies essential for them** may now be needed more broadly
- **Information overwhelm** affecting everyone
- **Tools designed for ADD** becoming universally valuable

## The Maturity Factor

**"At the tender age of 69 as an ADD person, my executive function is finally fully matured"**

This enabled Doug to:
- Recognize the problem clearly
- Find the solution
- Learn it quickly
- Implement it systematically
- Reap immediate benefits

## Executive Function Components

What Doug's matured executive function enabled:
- **Problem recognition**: Seeing the tab problem clearly
- **Solution seeking**: Actively looking for tools
- **Rapid learning**: Mastering the feature quickly
- **Systematic application**: Organizing 250 tabs efficiently
- **Follow-through**: Actually closing and managing groups

## Implications for Tool Design

### What Made Tab Groups Work

**Simple**:
- Native to browser
- No installation
- Basic interface

**Powerful**:
- Solves real problem
- Flexible organization
- Visible results
- Memory benefits

**Accessible**:
- Always there in the menu
- Built-in, not add-on
- No subscription
- Works immediately

### Design Lesson
The best tools:
- Solve real overwhelm problems
- Are simple enough to learn
- Are powerful enough to transform
- Match the user where they are

## Related to Other Topics

### Remixability
Like [[Scott Moehring]]'s modular approach - taking complexity and making it manageable chunks

### Curiosity and Attention
Overwhelm as barrier to engagement - organization as enabler

### Human Potential
Meeting specific needs to unlock contribution

## Browser Support

**Tab Groups available in**:
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Brave
- Other Chromium-based browsers

**Implementation varies** slightly by browser but core concept is consistent.
