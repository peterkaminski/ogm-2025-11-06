# Agriculture of the Middle

> **Note**: Term used by [[Klaus Mager]] to describe small-to-medium farmers during his [[Regenerative Agriculture]] discussion on the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## Who Are They?

Small to medium-sized farmers who:
- Can't access wholesale markets
- Too big for just farmers markets
- Too small for industrial agriculture
- Squeezed by economies of scale

## The Problem

**Market Access**:
- CSAs + farmers markets = only ~3% of total food sales
- Can't compete with industrial agriculture
- Can't afford capital-intensive "smart agriculture"
- Being excluded from market

**Equipment Costs**:
- Need different equipment for regenerative practices
- Cover crops require special machinery
- Expensive initial investment

## Klaus's Solution

**Aggregation/Bundling**:
- Small farmers working together
- Combined access to wholesale markets
- Shared infrastructure

**Dual Revenue**:
- Food crop (traditional)
- Environmental services (new)
- Makes regenerative practices economically viable

## Why They Matter

This segment:
- Can adopt regenerative practices
- Not locked into industrial systems
- More flexible and adaptive
- Collectively significant scale

## Schumacher Institute Project

Working to:
- Get food hubs into wholesale markets
- Create secondary revenue streams
- Enable regenerative transition
