# Seeking Certainty

> **Note**: Topic that [[Victoria (Spain)]] mentioned she was researching for her novel during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## Victoria's Work

Writing a novel and "researching about how people seek certainty"

## Stacey's Response

[[Stacey Druss]] offered her framework: **Two Truths and a Lie**

"I think of every story as being... there's two truths and a lie in it"

This helps keep an open mind and constantly question "which is the lie"

## The Question

In uncertain times, how do people:
- Find stable ground
- Make decisions
- Navigate ambiguity
- Deal with unknowns

## Connection to Other Topics

**Curiosity decline**: Perhaps people seek certainty over curiosity?

**Information overload**: Too much conflicting information makes certainty harder

**Political polarization**: Certainty in tribal identity?
