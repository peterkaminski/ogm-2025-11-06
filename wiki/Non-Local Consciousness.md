# Non-Local Consciousness

The idea that consciousness is not generated by neurons in the brain, but rather is a universal field or "background radiation" that we tune into.

## Core Concept

**Traditional View**: Consciousness emerges from neural activity when we reach some "critical mass of neurons and activity"

**Non-Local View**: Consciousness is "the background radiation of the universe" and we:
- Tune into it "like a radio station"
- Occupy it
- "Snap in" to it
- When we die: "leave it, or meld back into it"

## How Jerry Encountered This

### Source 1: Sunil Malhotra (~1.5 years before call)

[[Sunil Malhotra]] (friend of OGM's) suggested this to [[Jerry Michalski]] on an OGM call:

"What if consciousness isn't a thing that materializes out of neurons in our heads... but what if consciousness is the background radiation of the universe, and we occupy it?"

"We sort of snap in, we tune into it, like a radio station, and then when we die, we sort of leave it, or meld back into it"

**Impact**: "Really sort of changed the way I look at things"

### Source 2: Dan Brown's "The Secret of Secrets"

Major plot point in the novel involves non-local consciousness

**Realization**: Jerry had "already put non-local consciousness in my brain from a completely different bit of research"

**Conclusion**: "Consciousness is, in fact, not a materialistic phenomenon of something that's happening in the chemistry in our heads, but is in fact a much broader thing"

## Territory This Enters

**Jerry's description**: "Woo-woo noetic science territory"

**His evolution**: "Which I'm beginning to respect a lot more"

## Connection to GABA and Perception

From the same Dan Brown novel:

### The Filtering Hypothesis

- Brain as **tuner** rather than **generator**
- [[GABA]] (gamma-aminobutyric acid) as primary inhibitor
- High GABA = filters protect us from overwhelm
- Low GABA = access to what's always there

### Hallucinogens Reframed

**Traditional view**: Drugs generate hallucinations in your head

**New hypothesis** (from the book): Hallucinogens "lower your filters so that you can see what's going on around you" - perceiving what's "always happening" rather than generating false perceptions

## Broader Pattern in Jerry's Thinking

Non-local consciousness is one piece that clicked with:

1. **Da Vinci Code** → Divine Feminine marginalization
2. **Leonard Shlain's work** → Same thesis, academic perspective
3. **Jerry's decades of work** → The word "consumer"
4. **Yin/Yang thinking**
5. **Non-local consciousness** → Latest addition

All "clicked in my head in a really wonderful way"

## Personal Verification: The Psilocybin Experience

Wednesday afternoon before the call, Jerry had his first psilocybin journey (first trip ever - "I've never done drugs")

### Experience:
- "Phenomenal" and "really transformative"
- Felt connected to "mycelial networks of the world"
- Felt like "everything all at once-ish"
- Understanding of special effects: "basically just copying what happens to you when you see everything"

### Interpretation:
Consistent with the non-local consciousness + GABA hypothesis:
- Psilocybin lowered filters (GABA)
- Experienced what's "always there"
- Connected to larger consciousness field
- "Perceive what's always happening around you"

## Implications

If consciousness is non-local:

1. **Personal identity**: We are tuners/receivers, not generators
2. **Death**: Not end of consciousness but disconnection from tuner
3. **Connection**: We're always part of something larger
4. **Perception**: What we see is heavily filtered, not complete reality
5. **Spiritual experiences**: Not hallucinations but filter reduction
6. **Meditation/practices**: Ways to adjust the tuning

## Scientific vs Mystical

**Tension**: This idea sits between:
- Materialist neuroscience (consciousness from neurons)
- Mystical traditions (universal consciousness)
- "Woo-woo noetic science" (attempting to study scientifically)

**Jerry's evolution**: Moving from skepticism toward respect for the territory
