# DeepSeek Controversy

> **Note**: Chinese AI discussed by [[Alex Kladitis]] as parallel to Western AI bias during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## What is DeepSeek?

Chinese AI system that emerged as competitor to Western LLMs

## Western Criticism

Media criticized it for:
- Being "biased towards pro-China stuff"
- Censoring Tiananmen Square
- Not "behaving by our standards"

## Alex's Point

Used this as comparison to show Western AIs also have bias:
- DeepSeek's bias was obvious to Western observers
- ChatGPT's bias less obvious to Western users
- **Both systems reflect their training contexts**

## The Insight

"Our AIs are also quite opinionated in certain directions"
