# GABA and Filtering

> **Note**: This topic was mentioned during the OGM 2025-11-06 call in [[Jerry Michalski]]'s check-in about his reading and psilocybin experience, but was not a main focus of discussion. This page provides background on the concept.

## What is GABA?

**GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)** is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. It plays a crucial role in reducing neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system.

## The Filtering Function

GABA acts as a neural "filter" that:
- **Reduces neural noise** by inhibiting excessive neuronal firing
- **Prevents sensory overwhelm** by dampening incoming stimuli
- **Regulates anxiety** by calming overactive neural circuits
- **Enables focus** by filtering out irrelevant information

### High GABA Levels
- Normal baseline state for most people
- Protection from being overwhelmed by sensory input
- Maintains cognitive and emotional stability
- Filters allow selective attention

### Low GABA Levels
- Increased sensory perception
- Reduced filtering of environmental stimuli
- Can lead to anxiety, seizures (in extreme cases)
- May explain altered states of consciousness

## GABA and Consciousness

The filtering hypothesis suggests:
- The brain doesn't generate all conscious experience but rather **tunes** or **filters** it
- GABA modulates how much information passes through to awareness
- Reducing GABA may reveal perceptions that are always present but normally filtered out
- This connects to theories of [[Non-Local Consciousness]]

## GABA and Psychedelics

Research suggests that psychedelic substances may:
- Temporarily reduce GABAergic inhibition
- Allow more sensory information to reach conscious awareness
- Create "filter reduction" rather than "hallucination generation"
- Enable perception of normally-filtered aspects of reality

## Connection to the Call

Jerry discussed GABA in relation to:
- Dan Brown's novel "The Secret of Secrets"
- His own [[Psilocybin and Perception]] experience
- The idea that psychedelics lower filters rather than create false perceptions
- Epileptic seizures as extreme GABA reduction events
- The relationship to [[Non-Local Consciousness]] theories
