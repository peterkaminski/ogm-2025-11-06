## Key Insight: Remixability

Scott's check-in focused on the concept of **[[Remixability]]** - making work that others can use to create their own things, inspired by [[Kevin MacLeod]].

### Main Points

**Inspiration**: Discovered Kevin MacLeod through a documentary. MacLeod has created 2,000 pieces of royalty-free music under Creative Commons, becoming "the most prolific composer you've never heard of" according to the New York Times.

**Impact**: One of MacLeod's songs has been played 31.6 billion times across TikTok videos, Facebook Reels, and other content.

**Philosophy Shift**: Instead of creating "perfect, self-contained" products, Scott is focusing on:
- Making **ingredients or recipes** rather than complete meals
- Creating things that other people can and want to use
- Enabling work to have "a life of its own through interactions with other people"

### Application to Work

Scott is applying this to his **universals frameworks**:
- Turned them into a deck format
- Made them modular so pieces can be moved around and recombined
- Believes this will make them more usable for others

### Related Chat Discussion

In the chat, [[Victoria (Spain)]] and [[Pete Kaminski]] engaged with Scott's ideas about curiosity and attention:

Scott wrote: "I am a highly curious person, and yet I'm engaging less because I have less available attention. We have killed boredom with the constant stream of information everywhere, and I think one symptom shows up as a loss of curiosity."

This connects to his larger theme of creating tools/frameworks that reduce cognitive load and enable others to create.
