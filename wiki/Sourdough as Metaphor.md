# Sourdough as Metaphor

> **Note**: Metaphor mentioned by [[David Witzel]] for thinking about [[Growth in Living Systems]] during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## The Story

Someone's Stanford application essay about:
- History of sourdough
- Pioneers crossing the country
- Keeping sourdough starter alive
- Women pioneers keeping it next to their breasts for warmth crossing mountains

## The Metaphor

**Sourdough as living system**:
- Must be fed and maintained
- Needs right conditions (warmth, food)
- Grows and reproduces
- Can be shared and propagated
- Dies if neglected
- Each starter unique

## Application to Economics?

David pondering:
- The lively nature (sourdough is alive)
- Growth patterns
- Care requirements
- Sharing and propagation
- Resilience and fragility

"That's as far as I've got, and I need to take it to, um... pizza, much more... much smarter AI now to try and evaluate it"

## Why This Metaphor?

**Different from mechanical growth**:
- Not linear accumulation
- Requires ongoing care
- Lives in relationship
- Can be shared without loss
- Quality matters more than quantity

**Economic implications**:
- Growth requires tending
- Right conditions matter
- Can't just extract
- Living systems need feeding
- Sharing creates more
