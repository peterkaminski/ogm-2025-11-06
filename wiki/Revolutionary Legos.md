# Revolutionary Legos

> **Note**: Concept mentioned by [[Gil Friend]] connecting to [[Scott Moehring]]'s [[Remixability]] idea during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## Gil's Insight

In response to Scott's remixability concept:

"Revolutionary Legos - building the pieces of the puzzle and just throwing them out there in a way where they self-propagate"

## The Idea

Instead of:
- Complete strategies
- Finished systems
- Comprehensive solutions

Create:
- **Modular pieces**
- **Building blocks**
- **Self-propagating components**

That enable:
- Multiple strategies around the world
- Local adaptation
- Creative recombination

## Kevin MacLeod Example

Music pieces that:
- Self-propagate through use
- Get recombined endlessly
- Enable others' creations
- Spread through utility

## The Quote Connection

"It's amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit"

Revolutionary Legos embody this - you release building blocks and let others build.

## Strategy Implications

Rather than trying to:
- Build complete strategies centrally
- Control implementation
- Maintain coherence

Feed the development of:
- Diverse strategies
- Local innovations
- Emergent patterns
