# Automated Transcript De-identification

> **Note**: This was [[Gil Friend]]'s main check-in topic during the OGM 2025-11-06 call. See [[Gil Friend]] for full details.

## The Challenge

Gil works as executive coach with CXO-level clients. To use AI bots for analysis, he needs to remove personally identifying information (PII) from coaching session transcripts.

## Previous Method

Manual global search and replace - time-consuming and error-prone

## New Solution

"Vibe coding" technique using:
- Custom bot on Delphi platform
- More sophisticated custom bot built with [[Alex Kladitis]]
- Claude Code helped build drag-and-drop tool

## Status

- Finished configuring yesterday (before call)
- Testing with clients
- If successful: "off to the races"

## Significance

**Re-entry into coding**: Gil's "first re-entry into the world of coding in, like, 100 years"

Finding it "remarkable what's possible" with modern AI tools

## The Bots

Once transcripts are de-identified, Gil feeds them into coaching bots that help:
- Track client progress
- Identify patterns
- Provide insights
- Support coaching process
