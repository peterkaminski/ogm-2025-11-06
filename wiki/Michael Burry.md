# Michael Burry

> **Note**: Referenced during [[AI Financial Bubble]] discussion on the OGM 2025-11-06 call as someone currently shorting tech stocks.

## Who is Michael Burry?

**"Real-Life Market Genius From The Big Short"** - subject of Michael Lewis's book and subsequent film.

## Famous For

Successfully predicted and profited from the 2008 housing market collapse by shorting mortgage-backed securities.

## Current Activity (2025)

Has a fund set up to **short the tech sector**, specifically:
- NVIDIA

## The Palantir CEO Incident

When interviewed about Burry shorting Palantir:
- CEO Alex Karp looked "panicked"
- "Oh, this is really bad. Oh, this is not fair, oh..."
- "Deer in the headlights" - [[Doug Breitbart]]
- Stock price dropped 12%

## The Timing Problem

**New Yorker article from 2016**: "Michael Burry... Thinks Another Financial Crisis Is Looming"

If you acted on that warning, you would have:
- Missed a decade of market growth
- Eventually run out of money from shorting

Jerry's point: "Timing is everything in these things. And it's a little nutty."

## The Question

Can someone be a short for a long time and still be successful? History suggests it's very difficult.
