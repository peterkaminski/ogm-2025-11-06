# Open Source

> **Note**: Related concept to [[Remixability]] and [[Creative Commons]] mentioned during the OGM 2025-11-06 call discussions.

## The Model

Software (or other works) where:
- Source code is publicly available
- Can be modified and redistributed
- Often community-developed
- Various license types

## Connection to Remixability

Similar philosophy to [[Kevin MacLeod]]'s approach:
- Create ingredients, not just finished products
- Enable others to build on your work
- Value use over control
- Community benefit over individual profit

## Examples in Context

**Software**: Linux, many development tools Pete uses

**Music**: Kevin MacLeod's Creative Commons library

**Frameworks**: Scott's universals becoming modular

## The Philosophy

Maximize:
- Reusability
- Adaptation
- Innovation
- Collective benefit

Rather than:
- Control
- Attribution
- Exclusive ownership
