# Environmental Services Revenue

> **Note**: Core innovation in [[Klaus Mager]]'s [[Regenerative Agriculture]] model discussed during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## The Concept

Farmers grow **two crops**:
1. **Food crop** - traditional revenue stream
2. **Environmental benefit crop** - new secondary revenue stream

## How It Works

**Payment for measurable environmental benefits**:
- Soil health improvement
- Cover crops planted
- Nitrogen runoff reduction
- Carbon sequestration
- Biodiversity enhancement
- Water quality improvement

**The Process**:
1. Farmer promises specific practices
2. Create contract
3. Monitor and measure outputs
4. Pay for verified benefits

## The Cascade Effect

**Example: Nitrogen Reduction**

To reduce nitrogen runoff, farmers must:
- Improve soil health
- Plant cover crops
- Consider no-till farming
- Rotate crops
- Possibly add perennials

**Result**: "All these other things fall into place"

One payment stream triggers system-wide regeneration.

## Successful Example

**Mississippi Delta**:
- Farmers paid to reduce nitrogen into Mississippi River
- Easy to measure
- Incentives sufficient to motivate conservative farmers
- "There's just so much money at stake that they are going to do it"

## Why It Works

**Economic alignment**:
- Makes regeneration profitable
- Not asking farmers to sacrifice income
- Adding revenue, not replacing it
- Measurable and contractible

**System change**:
- Single incentive shifts entire system
- Positive feedback loops
- Cascading benefits

## Scalability

Klaus's belief: "You can absolutely shift into regenerative practices at scale if farmers are being incentivized and paid for it"

## The Challenge

**Support structure needed**:
- Equipment costs for new practices
- Technical assistance
- Market infrastructure
- Measurement systems
