# Divine Feminine

> **Note**: Concept discussed by [[Jerry Michalski]] as connecting multiple threads in his thinking during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## The Concept

**Marginalization of the Divine Feminine** - thesis that:
- Goddess worship was systematically suppressed
- Feminine principles devalued in Western culture
- Patriarchy displaced balanced perspectives
- Historical revisionism

## Sources Jerry Connected

1. **Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code** - Popular fiction treatment
2. **Leonard Shlain's "The Alphabet vs. the Goddess"** - Academic analysis
3. **Jerry's own work** - Decades studying "consumer" concept
4. **Yin and Yang** - Balance of masculine/feminine principles

## The Click

"All three stories kind of clicked in my head in a really wonderful way"

Same thesis from completely different perspectives validated the pattern.

## Connection to Other Ideas

Part of Jerry's larger synthesis that later included:
- [[Non-Local Consciousness]]
- GABA and filtering
- Broader questions about perception and reality
