# Claude Code

> **Note**: This tool was mentioned by [[Pete Kaminski]] as his primary agentic AI tool during the OGM 2025-11-06 call. This page provides background on the tool.

## What is Claude Code?

**Claude Code** is an agentic AI coding assistant created by Anthropic that can:
- Read and write multiple files in a codebase
- Create and manage its own task lists
- Work autonomously on complex programming tasks
- Operate "about at the level of a human software developer" (per Pete)

## Versions

### Terminal Version
- For developers comfortable with command line
- Direct integration with local development environment
- Full access to file system and tools

### Web Version
- More accessible interface
- No terminal required
- Works on mobile devices
- "Easier on-ramp" but Pete notes it's "more like molasses" in some ways

## Pete's Usage

**Duration**: 6-8+ months of regular use

**Primary Applications**:
- Complex software development
- Bug fixes across multiple files
- Feature implementation
- Code refactoring

**Emerging Applications**:
- Document synthesis (see [[Agentic AI and Document Synthesis]])
- [[Field of Sheaves]] project
- Large text corpus analysis

## How It Works

Unlike simple chat interfaces, Claude Code:
1. **Receives goal** from user (e.g., "Fix this bug" or "Add this feature")
2. **Creates task list** for itself
3. **Works through tasks** systematically
4. **Reads and writes files** as needed
5. **Checks off completed items**
6. **Reports progress** and results

## Special Promotion (November 2025)

Pete mentioned: $250 credit for Claude Code Web
- For Claude Pro account holders
- Expires November 18, 2025
- Check Pro account for availability

## Comparison to Cursor and Other Tools

Part of the broader "agentic AI" category alongside:
- [[Droid]] (from Factory Eye)
- Cursor
- Other AI coding assistants

Claude Code distinguished by Anthropic's focus on safety and helpfulness.

## Adoption Challenges

### For Non-Developers

Pete's observation: Watching non-technical people use it was "like they had oven mitts on"

**Challenges**:
- Built by developers for developers
- High initial overhead
- Requires understanding of:
  - File systems
  - Version control (Git)
  - Project structure
  - Development workflows

### Web Version Paradox
- Supposed to be easier
- But can be harder in some ways
- Less direct, more steps
- Trade-off between accessibility and power

## Pete's Vision

"Everybody's gonna be doing this kind of stuff in 18 months, 24 months."

**Current State**: "You could be doing it today" but with challenges

**Offer**: "I would love to show some people how to do that more."

## Beyond Coding

Pete's main excitement: Using these same tools for **non-code text work**:
- Legal documents
- Research synthesis
- Serial fiction
- Framework integration (see [[Field of Sheaves]])

The same "agentic" approach applied to knowledge work.

## The "Embarrassment" Factor

Pete is "half embarrassed" by his [[Field of Sheaves]] work because it's "mostly built by AI"

This raises questions about:
- Attribution and authorship
- Human vs AI contribution
- Value of AI-assisted synthesis
- Future of knowledge work

## Doug Breitbart's Interest

In chat, Doug expressed interest: "Count me in on that invite. Would love to try my hand and see yours."

Arranged to meet with Pete the following week to explore.
