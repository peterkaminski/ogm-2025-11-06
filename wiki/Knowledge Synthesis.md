# Knowledge Synthesis

> **Note**: Core activity in [[Pete Kaminski]]'s [[Field of Sheaves]] project discussed during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## The Concept

Using [[Agentic AI and Document Synthesis]] to:
- Combine frameworks that address similar topics
- Create 10-20 page overviews
- Connect ideas across domains
- Find patterns across different approaches

## Pete's Application

Creating syntheses of:
- Collective efficacy
- Social cyclic theories
- Intention-action gap
- Strategy and management frameworks
- Government governance principles
- Commons stewardship by communities

## The Process

1. Notice frameworks that address same territory
2. Authors/creators often don't know about each other
3. Use AI to read and synthesize multiple sources
4. Create coherent overview
5. Human guides and refines

## The Ambivalence

**Pete's feeling**: "Half amazing, half embarrassing"

**The question**: What's the human contribution when it's "mostly built by AI"?

## Traditional vs AI-Assisted

**Traditional**:
- Human reads all sources
- Human synthesizes
- Takes months/years
- Clear attribution

**AI-Assisted**:
- AI reads sources
- AI organizes and drafts
- Takes days/weeks
- Murky attribution
- Questions of value and authority
