# Curiosity and Attention

> **Note**: This was a major theme that emerged from [[Victoria (Spain)]]'s observation and sparked extensive chat discussion during the OGM 2025-11-06 call. While not a formal presentation topic, it generated one of the richest conversation threads.

## The Core Question

**Is curiosity declining, or is available attention declining?**

## Victoria's Observation

From her experience designing courses and leading workshops:
- People willingly attend learning workshops
- They say they're interested in learning
- Yet when she posts conversation triggers in the community
- **Nobody responds**

Conclusion: "Curiosity is dropping in our world"

## Scott Moehring's Reframe

**The Attention Hypothesis**: "I'm wondering how much is a loss of available attention?"

Key insight: "I am a highly curious person, and yet I'm engaging less because I have less available attention."

**Cause**: "We have killed boredom with the constant stream of information everywhere"

**Result**: "I think one symptom shows up as a loss of curiosity"

## Pete Kaminski's Three Theories

Pete is "torn between" three possible explanations:

1. **Typical Human Development**: People naturally become less curious as they grow up

2. **Educational System Impact**: Schools "train passion and agency out of people"

3. **Social Contagion**: Being incurious becomes "a way to deal with too much future"

### The AI Test

Pete's observation about how the split manifests:

**Curious people**: "Use AI quickly as a bicycle (or jet plane) for the mind"

**Incurious people**: "Do the equivalent of trying to use the bicycle as a hammer or a chair, and discard it as terrible at the small uses they can think of"

## Jerry Michalski's View

Blamed "the consumerization of our world, which dumbs us down"

## Connection to Environmental Neurodiversity

[[Scott Moehring]]'s hypothesis: The information flood has increased to where:
- Neurotypical people now feel their filters are inadequate
- They have no coping strategies
- Meanwhile, people with ADD/autism have developed robust filtering techniques
- These neurodiverse strategies may now be needed by everyone

## Mike Nelson's Daughter

As a counterpoint, Mike shared that his 28-year-old daughter told him:

"The most important thing I have done for her has been instilling a deep sense of curiosity deep in her being"

This suggests curiosity **can** be cultivated and maintained across generations.

## The Boredom Factor

Key insight from Scott: **"We have killed boredom"**

Boredom may be essential for:
- Mind wandering
- Creative thinking
- Genuine curiosity
- Deep engagement

Constant information streams eliminate the empty space where curiosity traditionally emerged.

## Related to GABA and Filtering

Connects to [[Jerry Michalski]]'s discussion of [[GABA and Filtering]]:
- Modern life as constant stimulation
- Filters working overtime
- Need for cognitive "breathing room"
- Relationship between overwhelm and curiosity

## Implications

### For Education
- Need to create space, not just fill it
- Cultivate genuine questions, not just answers
- Protect attention as a resource

### For Community Building
- Design for attention constraints
- Lower barrier to engagement
- Accept that curiosity may need cultivation

### For Tool Design
- [[Remixability]] - lower cognitive load
- Modular approaches
- Enable creation despite attention limits
