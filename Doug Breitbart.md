## Key Insight: Tab Groups as Tab Emancipation

Doug shared a "life-changing" personal discovery of browser tab groups that freed him from overwhelming tab overload, connected to his broader philosophy about human potential.

### The Discovery

**Context**: At 69 years old, as an ADD person, "my executive function is finally fully matured"

**Result**: "Huge expansion of capacity capability to grapple with things and play with things, and do things, and use things" that were "opaque and impenetrable and unusable before"

### The Tab Problem

**Before**:
- 4-5 browser windows across 3 monitors
- 45-50 tabs per window
- Total: ~250 tabs
- Tabs so small they couldn't be differentiated
- "Emotionally, they're there. They exist."
- Approaching computer in morning: "overwhelming crap. Like, what do I do now?"

**Discovery Process**:
- Knew the capability had to exist
- Saw something flash
- Noticed "Tab Groups" in a menu
- "Okay, I think this is my path to emancipation, to tab emancipation"

**Implementation**:
- Because of "newly vested executive function," able to learn it quickly
- Sorted and bucketed 250 tabs into groups
- Closed the groups
- Closed browser windows
- Freed up computer resources
- "My poor little laptop that could" - was asking "mini-computer demands" of it
- Now: "only have the one or two tab groups up that were relevant in that moment"

**Impact**: "This is life-changing for someone like me"

### The Bigger Picture: Zooming Way Out

**Core Belief**: "Every human being has value to add and contribute"

**Three Key Inquiries**:

1. **Foundational**: Every human has value to contribute (if you buy this...)

2. **Operational**: "What do each one of those individuals need in order to be enabled to contribute?"

3. **Systemic**: "How do we meet everyone's needs?"

**Everything Else**: "If it is not germane to those inquiries is substantially irrelevant"

### Personal Impact

**What Tab Groups Unleashed**:
- "Flood tide of capacity"
- Organizing
- Moving into action
- "Unleashing the hounds in all sorts of ways"

### OGM Connection

**Projects Coalescing**: Touching ~12 projects, 60% have OGM in common

**Pattern**:
- Two completely independent projects connect
- They start talking
- Doug has awareness of both
- Doug sees how they complement and fit into larger context

**Hat Tip to Jerry**: "For being the energetic center of gravity out of which a lot of these things, for me, were connected with and met, and now coalesceable in some fashion that I have yet to think through completely, but that I'm working on."

## Chat Contributions

**Direct Message with Pete**:
- Pete mentioned agentic AI work
- Doug: "Count me in on that invite. Would love to try my hand and see yours."
- Arranged to meet for an hour the following week

**Financial Discussion**:
- Mentioned [[Michael Burry]] (from The Big Short) has a fund set up to short the tech sector
- "If you want to go straight Contra, he'd be happy to take your money"
