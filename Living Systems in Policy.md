# Living Systems in Policy

> **Note**: Integration challenge discussed by [[David Witzel]] during his check-in on the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## The Problem

**Public policy typically**:
- Doesn't focus on living systems
- May talk about "systems" but not living ones
- Focuses on optimization and efficiency
- Uses proxies for "good"
- Gets "trapped into making things a little bit better"
- Rarely achieves positive-sum abundance

## David's Question

How to integrate:
- **Regenerative notions** (emerging knowledge)
- **Living systems thinking**

Into:
- **Technocratic public policy** (his background)
- **Traditional economics frameworks**

## Living Systems Characteristics

That policy typically ignores:
- Cyclical patterns
- Growth and consolidation phases
- Self-organization
- Emergence
- Relationship-based functioning
- Resilience through diversity
- Adaptation and evolution

## The Bridge

Using **growth** as connecting concept:
- Both economics and living systems care about growth
- But they understand it differently
- Finding metaphors and principles from biology
- Applying to economic/policy thinking

## Examples

**Sourdough metaphor**: Living growth requiring care and conditions

**Regenerative agriculture**: Policy aligned with living systems

## The Challenge

Retrofitting living systems thinking into existing frameworks without discarding accumulated wisdom.
