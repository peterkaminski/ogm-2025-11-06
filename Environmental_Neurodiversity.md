# Environmental Neurodiversity

> **Note**: This concept was introduced by [[Scott Moehring]] during the chat discussion about [[Curiosity and Attention]] on the OGM 2025-11-06 call. This page explains Scott's emerging hypothesis.

## The Hypothesis

**Core Idea**: The information flood has increased to the point where many otherwise neurotypical people now experience what neurodiverse people have always experienced.

## The Reversal

### Traditional Understanding
- **Neurodiverse people** (ADD, autism, etc.): Struggle with filtering and overwhelm
- **Neurotypical people**: Have adequate filters and coping strategies

### Scott's Observation
**Now**: Many neurotypical people feel:
- Their filters are inadequate
- They have no strategies to cope
- Overstimulated and overwhelmed
- What neurodiverse people have felt their whole lives

## The Strategic Advantage

### Neurodiverse People
Have developed **robust techniques to filter and focus** because:
- They've felt overstimulated their whole lives
- Had to develop coping strategies to function
- Refined these strategies over years/decades
- These are essential survival skills for them

### Neurotypical People
Now experiencing:
- Sudden overwhelming stimulation
- No developed coping strategies
- Filters that worked before now inadequate
- Need for strategies they never had to develop

## The Insight

**"The strategies that are essential for one group might now be what's needed for another group."**

Skills that were previously considered "special accommodations" may now be universally needed survival strategies.

## Examples of These Strategies

### From Neurodiverse Community
- **Rigorous information filtering**
- **Selective attention techniques**
- **Environmental management** (reducing stimuli)
- **Task chunking and organization**
- **Time blocking**
- **Visual organization systems** (like [[Tab Groups Discovery]])
- **Reducing simultaneous inputs**
- **Planned breaks and recovery time**

## Connection to Doug's Discovery

[[Doug Breitbart]]'s [[Tab Groups Discovery]] exemplifies this:
- 69 years old with ADD
- Executive function finally matured
- Discovered tab groups
- "Life-changing" organizational tool
- Solved 250-tab overwhelm problem

This kind of organizational innovation, born from neurodiverse necessity, may be exactly what neurotypical people now need.

## Relationship to GABA

Connects to [[GABA and Filtering]] discussion:
- ADD/ADHD linked to GABA levels
- Different baseline filtering
- Strategies to compensate for different filtering
- Now those strategies needed more broadly

## Scott's Personal Experience

"I need more, because I feel everything everywhere all at once as just part of every day. Not to the extent of a psy trip (which I've only read about), but much more than the people I hang out with."

## The Information Environment

### What Changed
- **Constant information streams**
- **Killed boredom** (Scott's phrase)
- **No empty cognitive space**
- **Always-on connectivity**
- **Multiple simultaneous channels**
- **Rapid context switching**

### The Result
Previously "normal" filters and strategies insufficient for the new environment.

## Mike Nelson's Response

Shared that the former CIO of Google wrote a book about how his ADHD forced him to learn better information strategies:

**"Getting Organized in the Google Era"**

Another example of neurodiverse-developed strategies becoming generally valuable.

## Implications

### For Education
- Teach filtering and attention management to everyone
- Don't assume "normal" attention is sufficient
- Neurodiverse strategies as universal curriculum

### For Workplace
- Design for attention protection, not just productivity
- Recognize different filtering needs
- Value neurodiverse approaches

### For Technology Design
- Default to less stimulation, not more
- Enable focus and filtering
- Learn from assistive technology

### For Society
- Rethink "normal" vs "neurodiverse"
- Environmental factors matter
- Adaptation strategies for everyone

## Related to Other Call Topics

### Remixability
[[Scott Moehring]]'s [[Remixability]] concept - creating modular, lower-cognitive-load tools

### Curiosity Decline
The attention crisis manifesting as apparent curiosity loss

### Tab Groups
[[Doug Breitbart]]'s discovery as example of neurodiverse strategy

## The Name

**"Environmental Neurodiversity"** suggests:
- The environment has changed
- What's "typical" neurodevelopment is contextual
- Current environment may be "neurodiverse" relative to human baseline
- We're all adapting to an atypical information environment
