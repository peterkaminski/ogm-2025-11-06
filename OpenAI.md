# OpenAI

> **Note**: Discussed as part of [[AI Financial Bubble]] topic by [[Mike Nelson]] during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## Mike's Assessment

**"OpenAI is the AOL of our day"**

- Completely overinflated stock price
- Sam Altman using it to make deals
- Deals "not going to look very good in a year or two"
- Reminiscent of AOL-Time Warner merger (which failed spectacularly)

## The Strategy

Altman "doing exactly the right thing" - using inflated valuation while it lasts to:
- Make acquisitions
- Form partnerships
- Build infrastructure
- Lock in advantages

## The Bubble

Part of broader AI bubble discussion including cloud computing and AI chips.
