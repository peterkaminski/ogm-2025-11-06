# AI Financial Bubble

Discussion of the potential AI investment bubble and its implications for the economy and tech sector.

## Overview

**Presenter**: [[Mike Nelson]]

**Context**: Wall Street Journal has been running articles "every day for the last 3 weeks" about the AI bubble with "different versions on why it is"

## The Three Bubbles

Mike identified three distinct bubbles:

1. **Cloud Computing**
2. **AI Chips**
3. **Cryptocurrency**

## The AOL Comparison

**OpenAI = AOL of our day**

- Completely overinflated stock price
- Sam Altman "doing exactly the right thing" using it to make deals
- Deals "going to not look very good in a year or two"
- Reminiscent of Time Warner being bought by AOL

## The Economy IS AI

**Key WSJ Article Claim**:
"The U.S. economy is now AI"

**Data**:
- All U.S. economic growth for 12+ months from data center investment
- "If you just take that out, the economy's been flat"
- Trump policies making it worse

## Growth Unsustainability

**NVIDIA and others**:
"We're not going to maintain the kind of growth that we've seen from NVIDIA and some of these other companies"

**Timeline**: Bubble will deflate "either in a few weeks, or in a few years"

## Personal Stakes: Mike's Situation

**Investments**:
- Employee #130 at [[Cloudflare]] before IPO
- Good chunk of retirement in Cloudflare stock
- IBM stock
- Other tech companies
- "I tend to invest in what I know"

## The Central Questions

1. **Scope**: Will it drag down:
   - Just AI-related companies?
   - Entire tech sector?
   - Entire market?

2. **Strategy**: How many people thinking of "pulling out the profits from tech investments"?

3. **Alternatives**: "What in the hell do you put the proceeds into?"

4. **Indicator**: "Gold is up by a factor of 3" - others confused too

## Call Poll Results

**"Raise your hand if you think there's a bubble"**: Multiple hands

**"Raise your hand if you're seriously thinking about changing investment strategy"**: Three and a half hands

## Shorting Strategies

### Michael Burry

- Real-life market genius from The Big Short
- Has fund set up to short the tech sector
- Shorting NVIDIA and Palantir heavily
- Historical context: 2016 New Yorker article predicted crisis
  - Would have missed a decade of run-up
  - Question: "When do you run out of money from shorting?"

**Palantir CEO Response**:
- Alex Karp looked "panicked" when interviewed
- "Oh, this is really bad. Oh, this is not fair, oh..."
- "Deer in the headlights" - Doug Breitbart
- Stock price went down 12%

### Ben Hunt / Second Foundation Partners

- Shorted real estate bubble in 2008
- Runs asset management company
- "Confessed longtime short"
- Also founded [[Epsilon Theory]] and [[Panoptica.ai]]

## Timing Challenge

**Jerry's Historical Observation**:
"If you heeded the first warnings of, oh my god, we're in a bubble, you would miss the actual big run-up. And you would sell too early."

"If you miss the fall, because usually it's the first couple people who get off the merry-go-round who profit a lot, then you lose everything."

**Conclusion**: "Timing is everything in these things. And it's a little nutty."

## Complexity: Multiple Bubbles

**Jerry's Point**: There could be "several different bubbles going on" with different dynamics:
- Clear bubble in "frenzy to do AGI"
- Other parts "not so bubbly"
- "Really good, juicy, complex issue"

## Pete's Bigger Picture

From chat (09:27:05):

"We've been in a technology 'bubble' since, say, the PC era. Sure, there have been ups and downs, but we're stuck on tech 'inflation' (both capability and economic).

AI feels like a kind of endgame; either:
- The whole thing (technology, and modern living) crashes pretty hard, OR
- AI enables massive growth in productivity and even things like social justice, perhaps with high costs around giving up sovereignty or agency (or heaven forbid) humanity.

**The Investment Paradox**: What do you 'invest' in financially when everything will crash, or everything turns wonderful?"

## Alternative Suggestions (Semi-Joking)

- Pork bellies
- [[Rai stones]] (large stone currency from Island of Yap)
- "Plastics, it's the future" - Pete Kaminski

## Related Context

### Financial Advisor Limitations

Mike: "I have a very good financial advisor, but... you know, he's got some suggestions, but I'm just curious how many of you are thinking of strategies"

### Not a Financial Group

Jerry: "We're not a financially-oriented group, or that necessarily expert in this. There's probably different depths of expertise in the group."

**Suggestion**: "Might make a good topic for a call, like, is there a bubble? What is the bubble?"
