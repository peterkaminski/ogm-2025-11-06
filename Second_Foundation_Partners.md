> **Note**: [[Ben Hunt]]'s asset management company mentioned by [[Gil Friend]] during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## What is It?

Asset management company run by [[Ben Hunt]]

## Investment Approach

- Ben is a "confessed longtime short"
- Successfully shorted real estate bubble in 2008
- Takes contrarian positions

## The Question

Gil raised: "Can somebody be a short for a long time? Maybe so."

This relates to [[Michael Burry]]'s situation - being bearish for extended periods can be costly even if eventually correct.

## Connection to Panoptica

Ben's narrative tracking work through [[Panoptica.ai]] likely informs investment strategy - understanding which stories are gaining/losing power in markets.
