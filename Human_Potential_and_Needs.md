# Human Potential and Needs

> **Note**: Core philosophy articulated by [[Doug Breitbart]] during his check-in on the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## Doug's Framework

### Core Belief
"Every human being has value to add and contribute"

### The Operational Question
"What do each one of those individuals need in order to be enabled to contribute?"

### The Systemic Question
"How do we meet everyone's needs?"

### Everything Else
"If it is not germane to those inquiries is substantially irrelevant"

## The Tab Groups Example

Doug's discovery of [[Tab Groups Discovery]] illustrated this:
- He needed organization to contribute
- Tab groups met that specific need
- Unleashed "flood tide of capacity"
- Enabled him to move into action

## The Philosophy

**Human-centered design at deepest level**:
- Start with inherent human value
- Identify specific needs
- Meet those needs
- Unlock contribution

**Not**:
- One-size-fits-all solutions
- Ignoring individual needs
- Focusing on irrelevant questions

## Application to Projects

Doug noted 12 projects coalescing, 60% with OGM connections:
- Different people with different needs
- Finding what each needs to contribute
- Creating larger context where they fit
- Enabling mutual support
