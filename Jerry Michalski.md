## Key Insights: Non-Local Consciousness, GABA, and Psilocybin

Jerry's check-in wove together three interconnected themes from recent reading and a transformative personal experience.

### Mr. Rogers T-Shirt Story

**Small thing**: Wearing a "Beautiful Day in this Neighborhood" t-shirt from Pittsburgh's Mr. Rogers Museum

**Significance**: April (Jerry's partner) visited after giving a talk. Mr. Rogers played a crucial role in her childhood, telling her "she was okay just the way she is" during a difficult relationship with her mother.

**Artifact**: Brought back a "Kindness Zone" road sign-style decoration for their wall.

### Non-Local Consciousness

**Source**: Reading Dan Brown's latest novel "The Secret of Secrets"

**Plot Point**: Non-local consciousness - the idea that consciousness isn't generated by neurons but is "background radiation of the universe" that we "tune into like a radio station"

**Connection to Previous Thinking**:
- [[Sunil Malhotra]] suggested this concept ~1.5 years ago on an OGM call
- Jerry realized he'd already encountered this from different research
- "Gets you into woo-woo noetic science territory, which I'm beginning to respect a lot more"

**Parallels with Other Work**:
- The Da Vinci Code → Divine Feminine marginalization thesis
- Leonard Shlain's "The Alphabet vs. the Goddess" (same thesis, academic perspective)
- Jerry's own decades of work on "consumer" as concept
- All clicked together with yin/yang thinking

### GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)

**From Dan Brown's Book**: GABA is the primary inhibitor in our neural system.

**Function**:
- High levels of GABA keep us from being overwhelmed by stimuli
- Low GABA opens up perception dramatically
- Epilepsy mechanism: precipitous drop in GABA → brain overwhelmed → seizure
- Epileptics experience moments of "bliss" and "connection with the infinite" after grand mal seizures

**Connection to Consciousness Theory**: Hallucinogens may not generate hallucinations but rather reduce GABA levels, lowering filters so you can "perceive what's always happening around you"

### Psilocybin Journey

**Timing**: Wednesday afternoon before the call (his FIRST trip ever - "I've never done drugs")

**Setting**:
- Friend in neighborhood who is "completely trustworthy"
- Friend grew the mushrooms himself, tested them
- Incredibly safe and lovely experience

**Experience**:
- "Phenomenal" and "really transformative"
- Felt connected to "mycelial networks of the world"
- Felt like "everything all at once-ish"
- Gained new understanding of special effects in movies
- "Tried... to leave myself little doors or candles or gateways to step back into the experience" without repeating
- Still processing

**Impact**: "I feel like I'm transformed a bit, I don't know how."

### Later in Call

Jerry facilitated the check-in protocol, explaining:
- One person at a time, no conversation during check-ins
- Pick something "OGM-y" that "exemplifies what you've been up to"
- Embrace silence and quiet space
- Switch to conversation mode after everyone checks in
