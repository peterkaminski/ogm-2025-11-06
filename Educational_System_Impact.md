# Educational System Impact

> **Note**: One of [[Pete Kaminski]]'s theories about [[Curiosity and Attention]] decline mentioned during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## Pete's Theory

One possibility for why people seem less curious: "Our educational system that trains passion and agency out of people"

## The Question

Is curiosity decline due to:
1. Typical human development (people naturally become less curious as they age)?
2. **Educational system** that actively suppresses natural curiosity?
3. Social contagion (being incurious as way to cope with overwhelming future)?

Pete is "torn between" these explanations.

## The Mechanism

If education is the cause:
- **Standardized testing**: Rewards right answers over good questions
- **Compliance focus**: Sitting still, following rules
- **Subject separation**: Fragmented rather than integrated learning
- **Authority-based**: Teacher knows, student receives
- **Time pressure**: No space for genuine inquiry
- **Grades**: Extrinsic motivation replacing intrinsic curiosity

## Counterexample

[[Mike Nelson]]'s daughter: Her greatest gift from him was "instilling a deep sense of curiosity deep in her being"

Suggests curiosity CAN be cultivated despite system.

## Related Discussion

**Scott**: Perhaps it's not curiosity loss but **attention loss** from information overload

**Jerry**: Blames "consumerization of our world, which dumbs us down"

## Implications

If education is the problem:
- Need to redesign for curiosity
- Protect natural wondering
- Enable genuine questions
- Create space for exploration
- Value process over product
