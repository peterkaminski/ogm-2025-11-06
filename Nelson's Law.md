# Nelson's Law

> **Note**: This principle was shared by [[Mike Nelson]] during the OGM 2025-11-06 call as part of his check-in. This page explains the law and its corollary.

## The Law

**"Nothing improves unless it changes."**

This deceptively simple statement captures a fundamental truth about progress and improvement:
- Maintaining status quo cannot lead to improvement
- Change is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for better outcomes
- Resistance to change means resistance to improvement
- If you want things to get better, something must be different

## Murphy's Corollary to Nelson's Law

**"Not every change is an improvement."**

This essential addition prevents misuse of Nelson's Law:
- Change alone doesn't guarantee improvement
- Some changes make things worse
- Direction and quality of change matter
- Need for discernment in what changes to pursue

## The Tension

Together, these create a productive tension:

**The Law says**: You must change to improve
**The Corollary says**: But change might make things worse

This captures the fundamental challenge of progress:
- **Can't stay still** if you want improvement
- **Can't just change randomly** and expect good results
- Must **navigate carefully** between stagnation and chaos

## Context in the Call

Mike shared this in the context of:
- Virginia political victories
- AI bubble concerns
- Technology policy debates
- Overstimulation from multiple sources of change

The law served as a framework for thinking about:
- Whether current changes are improvements
- How to push changes in positive directions
- Accepting that change is necessary but risky

## Applications

### To Technology
- AI is changing everything (the Law)
- But some AI implementations make things worse (the Corollary)
- Question: How to guide change toward improvement?

### To Politics
- Electoral change happened in Virginia (the Law)
- But political change can go badly (the Corollary)
- Question: How to build on positive changes?

### To Organizations
- Organizations must evolve (the Law)
- But reorganizations often fail (the Corollary)
- Question: How to change thoughtfully?

### To Personal Life
- Personal growth requires change (the Law)
- But not all life changes are beneficial (the Corollary)
- Question: How to choose which changes to make?

## Philosophical Implications

### On Progress
- Progress is not automatic
- Requires both change AND direction
- Neither conservatism nor change-for-its-own-sake works

### On Risk
- Improvement always involves risk
- Staying same is also risky (missed opportunities)
- The question is which risks to take

### On Judgment
- Requires discernment about:
  - What needs to change
  - How to change it
  - Whether a change worked
  - When to change back or forward

## Relationship to Other Concepts

### Evolutionary Biology
- Variation (change) is necessary for adaptation
- But most mutations are neutral or harmful
- Selection pressure determines what improves

### Innovation Theory
- Innovation requires trying new things
- But most innovations fail
- Success comes from trying many things thoughtfully

### Systems Thinking
- Systems must adapt to changing environments
- But poorly-designed changes can destabilize systems
- Need for understanding system dynamics

## Mike's Context

As someone who:
- Worked in multiple administrations
- Observed decades of policy changes
- Works on technology governance
- Studies AI and internet standards

Mike has seen many examples of:
- Changes that improved things
- Changes that made things worse
- Stagnation that prevented improvement
- Necessary but risky transitions

## Practical Use

**When facing a problem**:

1. **Apply the Law**: What must change to improve this?
2. **Apply the Corollary**: How might this change make things worse?
3. **Navigate**: Find changes that maximize improvement, minimize harm
4. **Learn**: Assess whether changes were improvements
5. **Iterate**: Adjust based on outcomes

## Quote Context

Shared by Pete Kaminski in chat (09:05:31):

"Nelson's Law of Life: Nothing improves unless it changes.
Murphy's corollary to Nelson's Law: Not every change is an improvement."

This was among other summaries of check-ins, suggesting Mike considers this a core principle worth highlighting.
