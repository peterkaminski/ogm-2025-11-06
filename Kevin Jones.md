## Brief Check-In

Kevin had a very brief check-in focused on The Plex publication.

### Main Point

**The Plex**: Kevin referenced getting "the Plex" (appears to be a newsletter or publication)

**Content**: "I think, um... You should, uh... I'm really happy about the two people I asked to write for it, and they wrote this one, and I didn't have anything, and I was very happy with it, so..."

### Participation

**Early Departure**: Left the call relatively early in the chat log
- Mike Nelson at 09:00:52: "Gota go" (appears to be from Kevin based on context)

## Related Concepts

- The Plex (publication - needs more context)
