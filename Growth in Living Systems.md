# Growth in Living Systems

> **Note**: Central to [[David Witzel]]'s inquiry during his check-in on the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## David's Question

"What are the kinds of growth and the perspectives on growth that would inform traditional economics in a more of a living systems way?"

## The Problem

**Traditional Economics**:
- Relies heavily on growth
- Growth as solution to poverty
- Economies robust while growing, fragile when not

**Public Policy Background**:
- Focus on optimization and efficiency
- Rarely achieves positive-sum abundance
- "Trapped into making things a little bit better"

## The Integration Challenge

How to retrofit:
- **Regenerative notions** (emerging in many spaces)
- **Living systems thinking**

Into:
- **Technocratic public policy**
- **Traditional economics**

## The Bridge: Growth

"Living systems are kind of critical. Growth matters a ton to living systems"

But living systems grow differently than economies:
- Cyclical growth (not just linear)
- Growth followed by consolidation
- Differentiated growth (different parts different rates)
- Growth within constraints
- Eventually reaching maturity

## The Sourdough Metaphor

David's inspiration: Story of pioneers keeping sourdough alive:
- Sourdough is **living**
- Growth of sourdough
- Care and feeding required
- Warmth and conditions matter
- As metaphor for economic thinking

"That's as far as I've got" - needs more exploration

## Economics as Indigenous Knowledge

David's reframe: "We should think of it [economics] as Indigenous knowledge, probably"

Rather than discarding economics, integrate it with living systems wisdom.

## Connection to Klaus's Work

[[Klaus Mager]]'s regenerative agriculture creates:
- Two revenue streams (food + environmental)
- Mimicking natural systems
- Growth that regenerates rather than depletes
