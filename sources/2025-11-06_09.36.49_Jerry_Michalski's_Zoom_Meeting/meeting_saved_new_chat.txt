In return, members receive regular (usually weekly or biweekly) boxes or baskets of fresh, seasonal produce — and sometimes eggs, dairy, meat, or flowers — throughout the growing season.

	@Victoria, you may never see this, but I was thinking about your comment about the loss of curiosity. I’m wondering how much is a loss of available attention? I am a highly curious person, and yet I’m engaging less because I have less available attention. We have killed boredom with the constant stream of information everywhere, and I think one symptom shows up as a loss of curiosity.

	A great conversation.
	
	I'm a very curious person by nature, and observationally, I see a lot of people who are incurious. I'm torn between whether it's a typical human development as people grow up, or our educational system that trains passion and agency out of people, or sort of a social contagion to be incurious as a way to do with too much future.

	The place I see the curious / incurious split happen is when someone plays with an AI. Curious people use it quickly as a bicycle (or jet plane) for the mind; incurious people do the equivalent of trying to use the bicycle as a hammer or a chair, and discard it as terrible at the small uses they can think of.

	Re: curiosity. My 28-year-old daughter is a very special and empathetic person. Over the years, she’s said many deep and eye-opening things. But the BEST, by far, is when she said that I’ve been a good father but the most important thing I have done for her has been instilling a deep sense of curiosity deep in her being.

	@Mike Nelson  RE: overstimulation, I have been exploring the idea of Environmental Neurodiversity. The hypothesis is that the information flood has increased to the point where many otherwise neurotypical people now feel their filters are inadequate, and they have no strategies. Meanwhile, those with ADD or high-functioning autism have developed robust techniques to filter and focus, because they have felt overstimulated their whole lives. The strategies that are essential for one group might now be what’s need for another group. That’s my thought, at least.

	@Mike Nelson et al. re "bubble", to zoom about a bit we've been in a technology "bubble" since, say, the PC era. Sure, there have been ups and downs, but we're stuck on tech "inflation" (both capability and economic).
	
	AI feels like a kind of endgame; either the whole thing (technology, and modern liviing) crashes pretty hard, or AI enables massive growth in productivity and even things like social justice, perhaps with high costs around giving up sovereignty or agency (or heaven forbid) humanity.
	
	What do you "invest" in financially when everything will crash, or everything turns wonderful?

	@Jerry Michalski  I was fascinated about your explanation of GABA levels on filtering. I looked it up, and. Found a strong relationship between GABA levels and neurodiversity. It has given me a new thread to pull on about the nature of filtering. I need more, because I feel everything everywhere all at once as just part of every day. Not to the extent of a psy trip (which I’ve only read about), but much more than the people I hang out with.
