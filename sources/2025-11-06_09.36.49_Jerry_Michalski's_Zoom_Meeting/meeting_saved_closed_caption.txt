[Alex Kladitis] 08:01:39
every single sign, or they had preached them and uncovered them, or whatever the technique was.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:01:43
But overnight, they did the whole switch.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:01:46
Hmm.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:01:47
in one night.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:01:50
And everybody… I mean, there's a couple famous photos of everybody crossing the street, like, to get on the other… on the new side.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:01:57
Uh, of the road.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:01:59
Yes.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:02:00
You can only do it in suite, sorry.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:02:02
Please.

[Stacey Druss] 08:02:02
Sorry, did you… did you send out a reminder? Because I didn't get one. I don't know if everybody else got one today.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:02:07
Uh…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:02:08
I did.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:02:09
I got one.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:02:09
I… I sent it out a couple days ago.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:02:11
So, it wasn't the night before. So, uh, I did, it was just earlier than expected.

[Stacey Druss] 08:02:16
Yeah, because I did a search, I didn't get one at all.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:02:19
Oh, shoot. Okay.

[Stacey Druss] 08:02:21
Forever. But anyway. And you're not recording yet.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:02:24
Not yet, correct. I'm about to turn on the reporter, let me do that.

[Stacey Druss] 08:02:25
Okay.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:02:28
Just, uh, just in case, on the Sweden thing.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:02:31
Yep.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:02:31
Um, I…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:02:34
Is there a case where this has been done in any other country? Because

[Alex Kladitis] 08:02:37
I just think Sweden could get away with it. Northern… Northern Europe.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:02:43
I cannot imagine Southern Europe doing anything like that.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:02:46
It's just… it's just…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:02:50
This, uh, this is the OGM weekly call for Thursday, November 6th, 2025.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:02:54
And we're talking about switching from left-hand drive to right-hand drive.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:02:59
Whoops

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:06
and inconveniently, I was just receiving a call, which I declined.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:10
Um,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:03:11
Actually, it's about driving on the left side of the road to driving on the right side of the road.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:15
Thank you, yeah, I was trying to…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:03:16
the right-hand drive and left-hand drive is the reverse thing, it's where the wheel is.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:20
And left-hand drive… right.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:23
Um…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:24
Exactly.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:03:27
So…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:27
And I… I… can anybody Google whether other countries have done this besides Sweden?

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:31
Um, or even clawed, or somebody else?

[Pete Kaminski] 08:03:32
Uh, there's a couple. Iceland…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:03:34
Nigeria, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, Yemen.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:36
Yeah. I mean, there were so much…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:03:38
What's fascinating?

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:03:40
Peter does all do it overnight?

[Alex Kladitis] 08:03:40
What's fascinating is that all…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:03:43
Um…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:03:45
Pretty close, yeah.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:03:45
implies a level of coordination that's probably rare.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:03:52
Uh, it's… I haven't quite got to how fast it was, but it was pretty fast, too.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:03:58
Yeah.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:03:58
you kind of have to do it… you have to do it all at once. Go ahead, Alex.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:03:59
It's fascinating, though, that

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:04:01
Yeah, yeah.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:04:02
The main reason was… it was the British Empire, and they drove on the left.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:04:07
So, why did the US…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:04:08
Yeah.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:04:10
go to the right from the start.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:04:13
There were supposedly a colony ones, sort of.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:04:13
It's… it's… it's whether you descend from England or Germany.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:04:18
So, Germans were on the right.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:04:20
So, was there a time where the…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:04:24
different states in the U.S.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:04:26
the carriages were driving in the wrong… the different side.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:04:28
That's a good question.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:04:30
A good question. We, you know, we could look this up. And I seem to remember that at one point, left or right-hand drive had to do with which hand was free when you were in the carriage,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:04:41
With horses. And so if you… most people are right-handed, so you wanted to be able to use your right hand

[Jerry Michalski] 08:04:48
defensively, I have no idea, but I think that had something to do with…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:04:50
I heard that it's… I heard that it stems from tournaments, from Knights tournaments, where you have the right hand free for your jousting tournaments, where your right hand free for your weapon, but that may be totally crap, I don't know.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:04:54
From jousting?

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:01
Yeah. So here we go. We have our amateur historical theories.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:05
Uh, to warm up our space.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:05:06
I think another one is, what side of the ship you unload.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:05:07
Mm-hmm.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:11
Well, that's port and starburg.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:05:12
And…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:05:13
Hmm.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:05:14
But I think that descended, or it went into… yeah.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:16
You think it's connected?

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:05:19
Hmm.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:19
Oh, now I'm… Latigo is a whip.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:21
Victoria. Um…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:25
The, um…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:27
Uh, briefly, we… before the invented the rudder at the stern of the ship,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:31
Uh, there were steer boards.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:33
And this is the origin of the words, uh, cyborg.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:37
Uh, because it was actually the… well, more interestingly, perhaps,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:42
The steer board, because most people were right-handed, was usually on the right side of your ship,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:47
And you didn't want to damage the steer board when you docked, so you would dock on… you would put the port on the port side.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:54
And that's why we have steerboard and port.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:56
Which became important starboard.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:05:57
Hmm.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:05:59
Yeah, so that's why it's the port. The port was always on your… on your left.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:05:59
Oh, right.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:06:01
I like that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:06:03
I'm so glad I come to OGM.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:06
You know,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:06:06
However, I don't know all kinds of things.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:08
Alright, some days I feel like cliff clavering. I'm full of shit like that, so…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:12
Um, off we go.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:06:14
The different countries switched in one day. The difference is actually the lead time. Sweden took 3 or 4 years, and other countries took 1 or 2.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:06:21
Mm-hmm.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:23
Thank you. Um…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:27
various. Today, we are on the first Thursday of November, which

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:32
typically means we do a check-in routine,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:36
Um, Victoria, I don't think you've been through one of our check-in rounds, so I'll explain the protocol.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:41
I am going to not moderate until everybody has checked in only once. We don't want any conversation between the check-ins. Each of us is just going to check in and say, what OGM-y thing is on our minds, or have we done?

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:54
is, like, active for us.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:06:55
It's not… the idea is not to sort of dump the whole laundry list of everything you're doing into the call, but rather to pick something that feels

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:05
exemplifies what you've been up to in some sense.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:08
And, uh, we don't use the chat, and this is difficult, I know, but especially for Pete and for me, who adore…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:16
Um, following things up with, oh, I found it, I found it, here's… look, look what the link is.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:07:17
Hm.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:21
But Pina and I will probably do that privately, and then once everybody has checked in once, we switch back into normal conversational mode,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:28
But I… during the check-in, whoever wants to talk next, raise your hand, or just, if nobody has their hand raised, just step in.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:35
stepped into the call. Whenever you're moved to, uh,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:40
check in. And, um…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:42
What am I forgetting about the protocol?

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:47
I think that's most of it. So, try not to engage in conversation during the check-in route. It's just one person at a time.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:07:53
And then just make notes on a piece of paper or in the chat without hitting enter, without hitting return, so it doesn't go to the chat.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:00
But make notes about stuff you'd like to talk about. When we go back into conversation mode, that's all.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:06
Uh, there you go. Excellent.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:09
Um, so with that…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:11
I am going to mute myself, and uh…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:15
Oh, oh, I know what I forgot.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:17
We… during check-in rounds, we like, um, empty space. We like quiet.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:23
So, it's perfectly fine for us to be still,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:26
And just hang out with each other, kind of quicker meeting style.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:29
That is a big plus, because

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:32
This is a bit of an antidote to our normally frenzied pace.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:35
Uh, through conversations.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:37
That's the thing I forgot.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:08:39
Jerry, could I just suggest, before we go into formal check-in round, that, uh, silence is not a terrible thing even during a normal call?

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:08:46
We made a little more breath.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:46
Oh, and…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:48
Agreed, and I occasionally… I occasionally take us into silence during a normal call, but I often… I often forget for too long, so…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:08:49
Anytime.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:08:53
Yep.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:08:56
I welcome it when you do it.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:08:57
Thank you. And I love taking groups into silence, and they always welcome it. Everybody's like, oh, okay, good. And you can just see people,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:09:06
tune in differently, so it's lovely. Thank you for the reminder again.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:09:10
Uh, with that, I'm going to mute myself and see who wants to be our first, uh, check-in.

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:22
I think I'm gonna go first.

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:25
No.

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:28
Um, so…

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:32
thinking about my personal projects and stuff,

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:35
I stumbled onto a guy named Kevin McLeod.

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:39
through a documentary that I haven't watched yet. So, Kevin McLeod.

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:44
has made 2,000 pieces of royalty-free music.

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:49
And made them available under the Creative Commons.

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:53
He did this just…

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:55
He was a composer and decided to start doing this.

[Scott Moehring] 08:09:59
And as a result, his music has been picked up and used

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:04
In the backgrounds of…

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:06
countless TikTok videos and…

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:08
Facebook Reels and all that kind of stuff.

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:13
Um, one of his songs has been played 31.6 billion times.

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:19
He's the most prolific composer you've never heard of, according to the New York Times.

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:25
And what it made me think about…

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:28
was the idea of…

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:32
Remixability.

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:33
of what you are producing.

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:36
And instead of making meals, making…

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:40
Perhaps ingredients or recipes.

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:43
And things that other people can and want to use to create things that are theirs.

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:50
As opposed to…

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:52
spending most of my time creating something that's…

[Scott Moehring] 08:10:57
perfect and self-contained, and…

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:00
is its own thing.

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:02
never to be taken apart and…

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:09
given a life of its own.

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:11
through interactions with other people.

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:14
So, that relates to the projects that I've been working on, and it's kind of given me a different sort of perspective on

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:21
that idea. How can I make the things that I'm doing…

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:27
more…

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:29
remixable by the people who might want to use them.

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:33
I've talked about my universals.

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:36
uh, set of…

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:39
frameworks, and I've…

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:41
turned them into a little deck that I've been playing around with.

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:44
And the ability to take

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:46
several, and move them around, and recombine them, and…

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:50
All of that has changed it for me.

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:53
And I hope that it's going to make it actually more usable.

[Scott Moehring] 08:11:57
for other people, should I publish this?

[Scott Moehring] 08:12:00
And that's it

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:31
Well, I'll go.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:34
And I'll confess I'm finding it very hard not to comment on what Scott just said, but I won't.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:42
Most OGM-y thing for me, and Alex will like hearing about this, I've been working on vibe coding, um, a technique for scrubbing, uh, for automatically de-identifying.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:54
transcripts of coaching conversation that I'm having with my clients. As most of you know, I'm

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:12:59
Primarily working these days as an executive coach.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:03
Excuse me.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:06
Um, for CXOs and founders, uh, who are purpose-driven. Um, I, um,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:12
I de-identify the conversations, so I feed them into one of two bots that I've got running, one on Delphi and one that Alex and I have been building custom in the lab, which is more cool and sophisticated.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:23
And of course, to use that, I have to get any personally identifying information out of the scheme. I've done that with manual global search and replace for a long time, and now I've got… Claude has built me a drag-and-drop,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:35
finished configuring it yesterday, and today I'll test it on a handful of clients and see how well it does, and if it works well, then we're off to the races.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:44
Um, and, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:46
aside from the specifics of that, it's cool for me to be diving in… this is my first re-entry into the world of coding in, like, 100 years.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:54
And so, kind of remarkable what, uh, what's possible, um,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:13:59
Both out of the box and with kind of fine-tuning that becomes available. I know that a number of you have done way more than me.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:14:06
Um, but that's the OGME report from me for today.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 08:14:12
And I'm still here, but I'm gonna hide, because I'm preparing breakfast, and you don't want to watch that.

[Stacey Druss] 08:15:01
I'm passing today

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:36
I'll go, um…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:38
If I may, um…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:41
Something that surprised me, uh, happened.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:44
This week, I came across this week. Sadly, it's going to be an AI thing, but…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:48
slightly different, I hope.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:50
So, ever since LLMs have become so powerful, I have set up a number of them where

[Alex Kladitis] 08:15:58
this kind of finance pages, and they give me a report every morning, they scan lots of medical things, give me reports, etc.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:05
So, won't go into it, but I just wanted to know what China was saying.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:10
And I repurposed

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:13
I'll use the usual, the same format, more or less. I repurposed it so that…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:18
it's task, as I asked it.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:20
was to…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:23
scan all the Chinese, or as many Chinese

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:26
big daily website papers, whatever.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:28
And tell me what the Chinese are talking about.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:31
Just that.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:34
And what I've found, cut a long story short, is that…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:37
I'm using ChatGPT. It would not give me…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:41
what the Chinese papers are saying, without telling me

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:45
why they're either wrong, or…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:47
this is a true situation, or whatever, it was as if…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:49
inbuilt into the AI,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:52
is this bit that says,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:55
what have the Chinese say is not true?

[Alex Kladitis] 08:16:56
this is the interpretation that we're giving. And I've tried really hard to say to it, do not

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:01
comment on it. Do not do anything. All I want is a strap line of what they're saying. That is it.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:07
And the reason I found it interesting was because, in the end, I gave up, because we just wouldn't do it.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:11
Um, the reason I find it interesting is because when DeepSeek came up, which is the Chinese thing,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:17
the whole press was saying it's biased towards

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:21
pro-China stuff.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:23
And it was, if you… if you tried to do anything, anything politics with it, it would, and particularly Tiananmen Square,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:29
it would actually not…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:31
not behave in our spyer standards.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:35
But I was surprised to see how…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:37
Obviously, in my opinion, it's inbuilt into the training data.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:42
But we have our biases as well. And more to the point,

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:47
it's, you know, we talk about AI being safe and whatever, you know, all this.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:54
And I'm surprised that it's so in-built. I could talk about this for a lot further, but basically, it just surprised me.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:17:59
that our AIs are also quite…

[Alex Kladitis] 08:18:05
opinionated in certain directions, particularly that one.

[Alex Kladitis] 08:18:10
Um… so…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:18:25
I'll go.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:18:27
Um… as you may know, I've been using Agentic AI

[Pete Kaminski] 08:18:34
assistance for software development for, I don't know, 6-8 months, probably longer than that. Um, so I'm using… I've been using Cloud Code, um, and it…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:18:45
is… it works with me about at the level of a human software developer.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:18:51
Um, agentic means lots of crazy things, and AI means lots of crazy things, but when I say agentic AI, it's a coding assistant.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:18:59
What I mean is…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:19:01
Something like an LLM, but set up so that it can read and write many files, source code files or text files, or whatever. And also,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:19:11
Um, one of the things it does is, uh, you can tell it

[Pete Kaminski] 08:19:15
to do something, and it will make a little list for itself. Here's a bunch of to-dos that I need to get Pete's bug fixed or feature implemented, or something like that.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:19:24
And then it goes down that list and checks them off, and does another thing, checks it off, does another thing. So it takes the LLM experience and kind of up-levels it towards

[Pete Kaminski] 08:19:34
An autonomous human kind of level, and I don't mean that it's smart like a human, or…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:19:39
thoughtful like a human, or creative like a human.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:19:42
Although it kind of is, all of those. Um…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:19:47
Uh, so, a thing that I've been tracking for a long time is doing the same thing with, uh, text, either non-fiction or fiction.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:19:56
Um, having a bot understand

[Pete Kaminski] 08:19:59
Like, a big chunk of, um, uh, serial fiction, for instance, and being able to write new episodes, or going over the whole thing and making a plan for

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:09
you know, new, uh, volume in a series, something like that.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:15
does that really well. Um, I think it would also work great for a legal team.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:21
Um, doing a bunch of work with lots of documents, and they kind of all need to fit together and change, you know, together, and…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:29
Uh, tell me, you know, tell me the…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:31
Um, overarching meaning of these documents together. Tell me which ones don't quite fit right. How would you rewrite it?

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:38
Go ahead and try rewriting that and see if I like the draft that you do. No, I don't like that one, throw it away, do another one. So…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:45
non-fiction, big research studies, fiction, uh, legal stuff, um, anything where you're using a corpus of documents and multiple people.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:20:57
So I've been super excited about this for a while, and have a hard time explaining to people why it's cool, and why they should be doing it as the same… same like me. I finally got the first taste of… I've worked with a couple people,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:10
adopting these tools, and…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:12
It's kind of a mix of, like, terror because, you know, there's a lot of overhead to get to be able to work with the tool.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:20
Um, it doesn't feel like a lot of overhead to me, because software developers built these things, so they built it so it…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:25
just fits… slots perfectly into a software development thing.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:29
And for me, it feels like there's a little bit of a difference between

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:33
building software and building Obsidian vault, and yada yada, and using Git, and it gets more and more complicated, kind of.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:39
So, um… so the newest one, Cloud Code, now has a web version. You don't have to use your terminal.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:46
Um, there's another one called Droid from a company named Factory Eye, which also has a web.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:21:51
The web versions also work on mobile, kind of, so we're right at the cusp of these things not being where you need a geek to… you don't need to be a geek to use it.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:01
Um, however, I've also… I've also kind of had a…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:06
I was really disappointed in the…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:10
And the difficulty with which a non-technical person had to kind of, like, muscle their way through it.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:15
I was watching somebody use it, and they were happy.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:17
But I could see it was kind of like they had an oven mitts on, and they were trying to do, you know, fine-grained tasks.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:25
Um, so…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:28
Anyway, long story short, um, I think… I think Cloud Code Web…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:32
I… at least some people are getting a $250 credit. If you go to your Cloud Pro account,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:38
it might say, you should try Cloud Code Web. It's… and here's $250 for you to spend by November 18th. Um, Droid has another big promotion right now.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:49
Um, more people should be doing this, and I'm kind of pulling back from saying everybody should do it right away, because

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:56
It's a little hard, um…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:22:58
And using the web version is actually even a little bit more hard than the terminal version, I think.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:03
Um, it's… it's an easier on-ramp, but goes…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:07
Because it's harder… it's more like molasses or something like that. Um, everybody's gonna be doing this kind of stuff in 18 months, 24 months. Um, you could be doing it today. I would love to show some people how to do that more.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:25
Um, kind of as a coda, one of the things that I've been doing, a lot of times from an OGM call,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:30
Uh, somebody will mention something, um…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:33
Uh, I think it was last week, actually, Stacy mentioned something about, um,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:39
uh… people in her building working together, and that makes a… a little…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:44
society that protects itself from outsiders and things like that.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:47
And I said, huh, that reminds me of the broken windows theory, that reminds me of this, that reminds me of that. And so…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:54
I think I've been doing for about 6 months is…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:23:58
I know there's a bunch of frameworks around a topic,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:01
Um, hey, AI, help me put together a wiki, uh, you know, a 20-page, kind of,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:08
paper slash thesis slash framework slash overview of sometimes things that are a little bit different, that people have kind of been looking at the same part of the world.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:18
and coming up with different ways to do it, and they don't talk to each other. So, the most fun for me is when me and the AI can kind of smash

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:25
frameworks together that ought to go together, but never have before. And so I've been building these 10, 20-page websites like that.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:32
collective efficacy, social cyclic theories, the intention-action gap.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:38
strategy and management frameworks, government governance principles, commons stewardship by communities.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:45
And I… I just do these kind of one-off things, and they're half, like, amazing, and I've… I've pointed out a couple of them in the OGM list.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:54
Um, and half I'm embarrassed by it, because it's mostly built by AI.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:24:59
So, I'm working with an…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:25:02
the AIs now to kind of frame that into what is good about these things, and what is bad.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:25:08
How do humans work with them? Why is it okay that the, um…

[Pete Kaminski] 08:25:14
that the AI has kind of organized things in a way that makes sense. So, I'm working on kind of a meta-collection of all these things together called

[Pete Kaminski] 08:25:24
field of sheaths. Each of these things is… I'm thinking of as a sheaf.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:25:29
Um, so now I've got, you know, 6 or 8 sheaves of whatever these things knowledge together. And, um, so I'm working on that. I'm too embarrassed to release it, and uh… yet. Um, but I am working on it. If this is something that's like, oh my gosh, Pete,

[Pete Kaminski] 08:25:45
Could I help, you know, could I do that? Could you help me do one of those myself? Um, I'd love to… love to hear from you.

[Pete Kaminski] 08:25:53
Thanks.

[Kevin Jones] 08:25:58
I'll go next quickly. If you guys got the Plex…

[Kevin Jones] 08:26:03
Uh…

[Kevin Jones] 08:26:04
I think, um…

[Kevin Jones] 08:26:08
You should, uh…

[Kevin Jones] 08:26:10
I'm really happy about the two people I asked to write for it, and they wrote this one, and I didn't have anything, and I was very happy with it, so…

[David Witzel] 08:26:53
Well, I'll toss in what I've been thinking about.

[David Witzel] 08:26:56
Uh, we're playing with the notion of growth. The framework is kind of like, how do I…

[David Witzel] 08:27:02
uh, integrate, uh,

[David Witzel] 08:27:04
regenerative notions that I've been, you know, developing over the last few years have been, you know, that have been emerging, I think, in many spaces in the last few years.

[David Witzel] 08:27:12
into kind of the technocratic public policy background that I've

[David Witzel] 08:27:15
that I've always, uh, thought of myself in.

[David Witzel] 08:27:18
And one of the key underlying things is that in the public policy world, we don't really

[David Witzel] 08:27:23
focus on living systems. You know, we may talk about systems, we may, you know, and maybe not often even that.

[David Witzel] 08:27:30
You just talk about optimization and efficiency and kind of, you know, there's, uh…

[David Witzel] 08:27:35
these other values that get, um…

[David Witzel] 08:27:37
It used as proxies for something good, I think.

[David Witzel] 08:27:40
Um, and so we, you know, you tend to get trapped into making things a little bit better.

[David Witzel] 08:27:45
Uh, and rarely can you get to kind of a positive sum outcome abundance kind of notions.

[David Witzel] 08:27:51
Um, and so I've been like, well, how would I retrofit some of that into, you know, our own…

[David Witzel] 08:27:56
borrow, uh, the old framings.

[David Witzel] 08:27:58
And, you know, what in another version of that is? What can we learn from traditional economics? Like, a lot of people kind of want to just throw it away and say economists are fools, and…

[David Witzel] 08:28:07
you know, they're all… they're funny, I like to make fun of them, so… but, you know, there's a lot of wisdom in economics, too, so I wouldn't… I don't think we should

[David Witzel] 08:28:13
toss it away. We should think of it as Indigenous knowledge, probably.

[David Witzel] 08:28:16
Um, so what, what is, you know, how these two things get together? One of the core words, anyway, I think, is growth.

[David Witzel] 08:28:24
traditional economics kind of relies on growth.

[David Witzel] 08:28:27
As… certainly as one of the answers to, like, do you want to get rid of poverty? How do you get rid of poverty? Well, you grow.

[David Witzel] 08:28:33
Um, so there's… there's that kind of component. But the other is just kind of, like, economies tend to be…

[David Witzel] 08:28:38
robust while they're growing, they tend to get very fragile while they're not.

[David Witzel] 08:28:42
Um, so there's… there's this kind of key…

[David Witzel] 08:28:45
brain in there. And living systems are kind of critical. Growth matters a ton to living systems. And so I've just been wondering…

[David Witzel] 08:28:52
Like, what are the kinds of growth and the perspectives on growth that would inform, kind of, traditional economics in a more of a living systems

[David Witzel] 08:29:01
way.

[David Witzel] 08:29:03
And are there, kind of, examples, you know, basically, uh,

[David Witzel] 08:29:07
metaphors that we can take from biological systems around growth that would inform traditional economics in new ways.

[David Witzel] 08:29:15
And for, you know, part of what provoked this was somebody talking about a story of how they had submitted for their Stanford application decades ago. They had submitted… they had to write a review of the book they'd written.

[David Witzel] 08:29:27
And the book that she had written was about the history of sourdough.

[David Witzel] 08:29:31
And how people, like, in the, uh, as they were crossing the country, would keep their sourdough alive, and what it would take to keep your sourdough starter alive.

[David Witzel] 08:29:41
And how, you know, the women pioneers were keeping the sourdough next to their breasts to keep it warm as they crossed the mountains.

[David Witzel] 08:29:48
And I was just thinking about, like, the lively… the sourdough being alive, and the growth of sourdough as being a metaphor for something.

[David Witzel] 08:29:55
So that's as far as I've got, and I need to take it to, um…

[David Witzel] 08:29:58
pizza, much more… much smarter AI now to try and evaluate it, but growth, what's… what's… what sort of insights can he get from growth?

[Klaus Mager] 08:30:17
Yeah, I got… I got an email yesterday from…

[Klaus Mager] 08:30:22
a mailing list, the Union of Concerned Scientists,

[Klaus Mager] 08:30:25
Sending out yet another, you know, last

[Klaus Mager] 08:30:29
urgent warning.

[Klaus Mager] 08:30:31
Um, and… and… and…

[Klaus Mager] 08:30:34
This has been going on for, like, 3, 4 years.

[Klaus Mager] 08:30:37
And it's from Oregon, actually, Portland's… I think Portland State, or Oregon State is, uh,

[Klaus Mager] 08:30:44
is the hub where now they're consolidating the data and, uh…

[Klaus Mager] 08:30:49
And, um, you know, explain how we are passing one tipping point after the next.

[Klaus Mager] 08:30:56
And it will be ignored, you know, it's just yet another alert that, uh…

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:03
people who pay attention to it, people who know what it is, saying, okay, yeah, I know.

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:08
And others will dismiss it, like, you know, it has been done for, you know, a really long time.

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:15
So the… the…

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:17
the… what… what is really missing here is a transition to what can you actually do about this.

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:24
And because there are lots of things, you know, we can do if we put our mind to it.

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:30
But, um, it's just… it just doesn't… doesn't seem to want to work, and of course, what we're doing

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:38
Uh, with our Food with Thought, uh…

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:43
effort here.

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:44
is to engage, you know, the neglected part of the market.

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:49
You know, so you have small to medium-sized, uh,

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:54
farmers, the… what's called the agriculture of the middle,

[Klaus Mager] 08:31:59
Ooh.

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:00
who can't get into the market.

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:03
Um, and…

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:04
The reason that is important is because

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:08
food and agriculture is probably the most damaging part of our…

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:14
into action with the natural world.

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:17
Um, destroying, you know, watersheds and soils and biodiversity and…

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:23
So it's incredibly damaging.

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:25
But it has the capacity to turn that. It has the capacity

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:31
Not to recover and to heal, and to regenerate.

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:35
Um, and the… in the… in the large companies, you know, whether that's Monsanto, or Nestle, or, you know, everybody in there,

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:43
They're working to automate this, they're working to reduce

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:48
Nitrogen by smart, uh,

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:52
technology, uh, climate-smart technology, and uh…

[Klaus Mager] 08:32:57
hugely capital-intensive,

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:01
even going to exclude more

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:04
Farmers who cannot get into

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:07
that, you know, the investment cost required to…

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:10
to build, you know, these automations, and it's not really necessary.

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:15
Um, you can absolutely shift

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:19
you know, into regenerative practices at scale.

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:23
If farmers are being incentivized and paid for.

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:26
So, so the, the, the…

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:29
what, you know, what we would need to know about it, of course, is a farmer who wants to put in a cover crop

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:35
And then put his cash crop in, needs different pieces of equipment to make that work.

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:41
Well, they're expensive. Now, so…

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:43
So how is a small to medium-sized farmer going to shift into

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:49
Environmental farming.

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:50
You know, without having

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:54
the support structure for it.

[Klaus Mager] 08:33:56
And so what we are arguing as a core point here is,

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:02
There are measurements.

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:04
that, uh, make it possible

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:07
to… to monitor what a farmer is doing, what the farmer has promised to do, so put a contract out there.

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:14
And then monitor the outputs of that. So there's already some great examples. For example, in the Mississippi,

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:21
But for Delta, um…

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:24
There are groups of farmers

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:26
who have been combined to reduce nitrogen one-off into the Mississippi River.

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:32
Which then, of course, runs down into the Gulf of Mexico.

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:35
While that's easy to measure, you know, it doesn't take much to…

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:40
to, uh, to track that. And the incentives have been sufficient enough for those farmers

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:46
who are, um, very conservative and typically not interested

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:52
Uh, in, in experimenting a lot,

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:55
there's just so much money at stake.

[Klaus Mager] 08:34:57
that they are going to do it. And…

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:00
Uh, and so what's these… and there are all kinds of little, like, one point,

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:07
uh… measurements…

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:08
that can… that have the capacity to shift the entire system.

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:12
Because in order to reduce the nitrogen one-off,

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:15
You have to find other ways to fertilize your crop.

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:18
You know, and so, you know, in the most…

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:22
A basic thing is soil health.

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:24
So if you have to increase your soil health, now we're talking about putting a cover crop on it.

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:29
You know, maybe doing a no-till, maybe rotating your carp into a different type of crop, maybe a perennial or so.

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:36
In order to do this. So all these other things fall into place.

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:40
So by building a secondary revenue stream, the farmer now has two crops.

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:45
He has his one, his food cup, and then he has an environmental benefit crop.

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:50
You know, that comes out that is linked together.

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:54
So we're saying this is one. I mean, in every industry,

[Klaus Mager] 08:35:58
You know, there are ways where we could

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:01
insert ourselves and provide the incentives at scale

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:06
You know, to catch…

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:09
the environmental deterioration that is, like, so obvious in your face now.

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:14
And in the… but what we are focusing on is the mostly NGOs, non-profit,

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:22
Small and medium-sized farms.

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:24
So, and the reason for that is that if you combine all of the farmers markets and the CSAs,

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:32
You know, and the, uh…

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:35
um… the low level, uh…

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:39
output of

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:41
of the sector, it's a single digit of total sales.

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:46
You know, last time I checked was, like, 3% of total sales is if you combine all CSAs,

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:52
Farmers markets, uh, into, into one… together.

[Klaus Mager] 08:36:57
So… so the… the… to… to get these farmers into the wholesale market, that's our objective, to assist

[Klaus Mager] 08:37:06
bundling or aggregating small farmers.

[Klaus Mager] 08:37:09
So they can participate in wholesale markets.

[Klaus Mager] 08:37:12
So I was just… I was just… I don't know, I wrote another newsletter. I mean, I was just thinking about…

[Klaus Mager] 08:37:17
How easy it would be

[Klaus Mager] 08:37:19
You know, to really make an impact, and how stubbornly resistant

[Klaus Mager] 08:37:24
the market is to… to engage in change.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:38:59
I've got one small thing and a bigger thing. The small thing is, um, I'm wearing a t-shirt

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:05
It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:07
Because April gave a talk in Pittsburgh, and after the talk, she went and visited the Mr. Rogers Museum.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:14
In Pittsburgh. And Mr. Rogers has a super interesting history, but Mr. Rogers played a really important role in April's childhood.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:22
Um… because she had a difficult relationship with her mom, and Mr. Rogers was telling her that she was okay just the way she is.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:30
And was one of the few entities that was doing that for her back in the day, and I didn't… I didn't realize how special that was.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:36
Until we had talked about it some years back.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:39
And uh… so it was lovely that she got to visit the museum, and she came back with a road sign.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:44
Uh, that says, this is a kindness zone, and it looks exactly like a street sign.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:49
that, you know, you would put it in a neighborhood,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:51
And we're gonna put it up on the wall here, so that's kind of cool. So that's tiny.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:55
then, uh, separately,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:39:57
I've been reading Dan Brown's latest Pock Boiler, The Secret of Secrets.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:40:03
And there'll be a tiny plot spoiler in what I say now, so if you really, really, really want to read,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:40:10
Um, my written book, because Brown is not Faulkner,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:40:14
Uh, but one thing I love about Brown is, from the Da Vinci Code,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:40:18
I picked up in, you know, two-thirds of the way through the book, he has this thesis about the marginalization of the Divine Feminine.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:40:24
And I think I've told this story here before, but I love that thesis, and I read

[Jerry Michalski] 08:40:29
Leonard Schlane's book, The Alphabet vs. the Goddess, within a couple months of The Da Vinci Code, and it has the same thesis,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:40:36
In an academic work, from a completely different perspective,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:40:39
And I had been chasing the word consumer for already a couple decades then,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:40:44
And I had gotten to the same place myself, thinking about yin and yang and a bunch of other stuff, all of which is a longer story.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:40:51
But all those three stories kind of clicked in my head in a really wonderful way, and I'm like, oh,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:40:55
And now I start reading Dan Brown, and one of the major plot points of The Secret of Secrets

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:01
is non-local consciousness.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:05
And that, snapped together with what Sunil Malhotra, a friend of OGM's, had said to me, I don't know, a year and a half ago,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:13
He basically said, hey, and I mentioned it on, you know, GM call somewhere,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:16
Uh, he said, hey, Jerry, what if consciousness isn't a thing that is… that materializes out of neurons in our heads when we have some kind of funny critical mass of neurons and activity? But what if consciousness is the background radiation

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:29
of the universe, and we occupy it.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:32
we sort of… we snap in… we… we…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:35
tune into it, like a radio station,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:37
Uh, and then when we die, we sort of leave it, or meld back into it, something like that. And that really sort of…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:44
change the way I look at things, and then by reading Dan Brown, I realized I had already put non-local consciousness in my brain from a completely different

[Jerry Michalski] 08:41:52
bit of research, and then it was the same… same general idea, that consciousness is, in fact, not a materialistic phenomenon of something that's happening in the chemistry,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:01
in our heads, but is in fact a much broader thing.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:04
a thing I like, which gets you into woo-woo noetic science territory,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:09
Which I'm beginning to respect a lot more.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:12
Um, that… and so one of the interesting things in the plot point is, so, uh, Tuesday night, I stopped someplace and have a meal, and

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:22
keep reading in the book, and I get to the point where they talk about GABA, the basically inhibitor or receptor in our heads,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:30
GABA is a bit of a… gamma-aminobutyric acid, G-A-BA, or GABA.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:36
And it appears to be the primary inhibitor

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:40
in our neural system,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:42
Which means that high levels of GABA

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:45
keep us from being overwhelmed by the world's stimuli.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:48
And when you have low GABA, you're suddenly, like, you take in a whole lot more, and apparently,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:54
Um, one of the mechanisms of epilepsy

[Jerry Michalski] 08:42:58
is a precipitous drop in GABA, which then causes your brain to be overwhelmed, and you go into seizure.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:04
Epileptics, when they come back out of a grand mal seizure, have moments of bliss, of like, you know, connection with the infinite.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:11
Um, and then they sort of reboot their brains back into being online with the usual constraints and filters on and everything else.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:19
Uh, and then she's, uh…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:22
the protagonist's other half, who's part of the plot, says, you know, have you ever done, like, hallucinogens?

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:28
They seem to reduce your GABA

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:31
levels, so that you can perceive what's always happening around you. It's not… it's not that they generate a hallucination in your head, it's that they lower your filters so that you can see what's going on around you.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:42
Um, which was all very funny because

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:44
yesterday afternoon, um, I had my first psilocybin journey ever, which, in fact, for me, is my first trip ever. I've never done drugs.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:43:53
And a friend of mine in the neighborhood posted me at his place. It was incredibly safe and lovely. He's completely trustworthy, just it was great.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:44:01
And I had a phenomenal experience. I… I felt connected to, like, the mycelial

[Jerry Michalski] 08:44:07
networks of the world. He had, uh, grown the shrooms himself. You can order kits, et cetera, et cetera. It works fine. He had tested it on himself.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:44:18
So he knew it was going to be good. Uh, and…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:44:21
it was really transformative. I had an incredible experience. And I'm still processing it.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:44:27
I tried during the experience to leave myself little dorms or candles or gateways to step back into the experience without doing the whole shroom thing. I don't know if that's going to work.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:44:37
Um, but I had… I had a…

[Jerry Michalski] 08:44:41
I have many different things happened. I felt like I was everything all at once-ish.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:44:46
Um, I now understand special effects, uh, and, you know, in movies a lot better, because they're basically just, like, copying what happens to you when you see everything.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:44:55
And, uh, trying to, you know,

[Jerry Michalski] 08:44:57
map that into graphics and visuals.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:45:00
Uh, but, uh, you know, the overwhelm you feel

[Jerry Michalski] 08:45:04
in the moment is not easily replicable in a movie theater when you're sitting, staring at a screen far away, and you know that there's no immediate consequences to you.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:45:12
Anyway, I feel like I'm transformed a bit, I don't know how.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:45:17
But, uh, it was thrilling.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:45:20
And with that, I am complete.

[Mike Nelson] 08:45:29
Well, Jerry, I'll step up and, uh…

[Mike Nelson] 08:45:33
I had 1,700 different ways to go this week, but I'll start with where you left off.

[Mike Nelson] 08:45:39
It is gratifying to know that I am not the only person

[Mike Nelson] 08:45:44
from the West Coast, who has never done a trip of any type.

[Mike Nelson] 08:45:50
I, uh, don't even… haven't even smoked a cigarette, which is… goes to show you how I… I did a total bypass past adolescence.

[Mike Nelson] 08:46:02
when I joined the Clinton administration in January of 20… uh, January 1993,

[Mike Nelson] 08:46:08
We all had to get security clearances, and in my case, at a pretty high level.

[Mike Nelson] 08:46:14
And, of course, they have the…

[Mike Nelson] 08:46:16
people interviewing you, and…

[Mike Nelson] 08:46:19
because it was the Clinton administration, and we had a whole bunch of people in their late 20s and early 30s, the first question was, okay, how often have you done drugs, and are you still doing them?

[Mike Nelson] 08:46:29
And I said, well, no, I've never done drugs.

[Mike Nelson] 08:46:32
And they just refuse to believe this, because it not only were, you know, every other person they'd interviewed had done drugs in college, and several of them were doing drugs.

[Mike Nelson] 08:46:44
Currently, and actually had to go on some kind of, you know, withdrawal plan, and had to be

[Mike Nelson] 08:46:51
tested every couple weeks to make sure they were on it.

[Mike Nelson] 08:46:55
I didn't know how much they didn't believe me until I had two random drug tests in the next 10 days.

[Mike Nelson] 08:47:05
But apparently, you know, they've chose to believe me, or maybe they just talked to somebody else who had worked with me when I was working with Gore.

[Mike Nelson] 08:47:14
in the Senate, and they were assured that, yeah, Mike Nelson, if there's anybody in the Clinton administration who hasn't done drugs, it's Mike Nelson.

[Mike Nelson] 08:47:23
But anyway, I am…

[Mike Nelson] 08:47:25
gonna riff on what you said about avoiding overstimulation, because the topic I was going to lay out there

[Mike Nelson] 08:47:32
is how I am feeling completely

[Mike Nelson] 08:47:36
Absolutely. Intellectually, politically,

[Mike Nelson] 08:47:40
overstimulated. Um, this is partly because I spent Saturday at TEDx Mid-Atlantic.

[Mike Nelson] 08:47:48
And we had some very powerful talks by everyone from Joe Trippi to Michael McFaul, our former ambassador to Russia.

[Mike Nelson] 08:47:57
to a rapper in DC who has sort of reinvented the business model.

[Mike Nelson] 08:48:06
He signed up with a major studio, he was doing cool stuff with other cool rappers,

[Mike Nelson] 08:48:11
And he was going all over the country.

[Mike Nelson] 08:48:13
And he said, forget this. And he started front porch. And he just…

[Mike Nelson] 08:48:19
goes out on his front porch, and he gets guests to come by, and they do things, and the neighborhood loves it.

[Mike Nelson] 08:48:25
And, uh, not as lucrative,

[Mike Nelson] 08:48:28
But a lot less exhausting.

[Mike Nelson] 08:48:30
So, just one example of some of the wild ideas that came out. But I've also just been overstimulated by the politics of what's happened in the last 3 days.

[Mike Nelson] 08:48:41
Uh, here in Virginia, of course, we've gotten a lot more political advertising than most.

[Mike Nelson] 08:48:46
Uh, you've all seen that one of my favorite

[Mike Nelson] 08:48:49
Former congresspeople.

[Mike Nelson] 08:48:53
Abigail Spanberger got elected, and we've known her personally for about 6 years, and she's very close with one of our best friends. Uh, so we're just delighted that a moral,

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:04
decent, smart,

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:06
kind person could… and a young person,

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:13
become our new governor. Virginia's blessed. We have a…

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:17
Uh, term limit system, you only get to be governor for one…

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:21
4-year term, and as a result, there's a lot of focus on building

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:26
talent, and being sure there's several choices.

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:31
But we won the governorship, lieutenant governor, and Attorney General, which is going to be incredibly important.

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:37
Given all the lawsuits that we're going to have to file.

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:40
against the Trump administration.

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:43
But most importantly, we went from having a one-person majority for the Democrats in the legislature,

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:50
to having a 14.

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:52
Seat.

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:54
Majority. So it's, you know, like,

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:56
52% to…

[Mike Nelson] 08:49:59
61%, something like that?

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:01
Uh, and around the country, we had other…

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:03
very impressive landslide victories.

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:06
So, it's clear that people are fed up with what Mr. Trump has been doing.

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:12
In some cases, they're also saying they're fed up with what the Democrats are doing, but they know that the Democrats are

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:19
unable to get organized, and therefore unable to do as much damage as Trump and his minions.

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:25
Um,

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:28
I'm also tracking a lot of technology developments around the world.

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:32
And that's, again, overstimulating. There's just too much going on.

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:37
The Chinese are…

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:38
pushing forward a digital identity system.

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:41
Which they're going to try to get other…

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:43
countries, or at least

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:46
multinationals to use. Um…

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:50
Clearly, that's going to have surveillance built in, so you're not going to be able to go anonymously from service to service on the internet.

[Mike Nelson] 08:50:58
Uh, the Internet Engineering Task Force was meeting.

[Mike Nelson] 08:51:02
This week, and one of the most lively debates was about

[Mike Nelson] 08:51:07
a new authentication system for…

[Mike Nelson] 08:51:13
um, digital transactions. And also,

[Mike Nelson] 08:51:16
a tool that would allow a website

[Mike Nelson] 08:51:19
to prevent people from coming and scraping all the content on the website.

[Mike Nelson] 08:51:24
And this led to a lot of interest and discussions about, you know, well, can McDonald's use this to make sure that Burger King can't go on its website and find out what its prices are, or what its sales are by

[Mike Nelson] 08:51:38
by store? I mean, it's really… it's… it's a good thing,

[Mike Nelson] 08:51:43
Because you do have these companies, these bots, that are scraping content and looking for

[Mike Nelson] 08:51:50
a stray social security number, then they're just putting a huge demand on all these websites, including non-profit ones.

[Mike Nelson] 08:51:57
So, but how do you stop a bad person from abusing the openness of the internet?

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:03
While allowing a researcher

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:05
to span, uh…

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:09
100,000 websites,

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:10
And go search through terabytes of data.

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:17
Tough, tough, tough issues, and we're… we're having all these

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:21
discussions, but they're all kind of below the radar, because we're all fixated on whether AI will

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:27
destroy world civilization.

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:28
So, I've been overstimulated, I don't know if I've stimulated you.

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:32
But, um, uh, I am intrigued by your…

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:36
experience, and uh…

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:38
This promise of…

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:40
finding a way to turn off the brain a little bit.

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:44
Um, I usually do that by going for long bike rides, which is my next, uh…

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:48
My next thing, and I have to say…

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:51
We have had more than a week of spectacular weather. It is peak, peak, peak fall foliage here in Washington.

[Mike Nelson] 08:52:58
Uh, and I'm trying to enjoy that.

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:00
being semi-retired, I can enjoy that.

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:04
But yeah, there's just… there's so much going on.

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:07
And I'd, I'd urge you to check out the Carnegie Endowment website.

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:13
some of the sessions that we've had over the last two weeks on everything from

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:18
information ecology.

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:20
A book by one of my new co- by one of my colleagues.

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:23
to a session I just listened to on the radical right.

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:27
Um, and the New World Order. I mean, it's just…

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:29
a lot of big thinking going on, a lot of change happening, which, of course,

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:34
could mean that we could have

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:37
an improvement!

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:40
Nelson's Law of Life is that nothing…

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:43
improves unless it changes.

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:45
Murphy's corollary to Nelson's Law is that not every change is an improvement.

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:51
But I'm gonna try to help push people in the direction of improvement.

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:55
Thank you. Long, long, uh, somewhat optimistic.

[Mike Nelson] 08:53:59
um… discreet.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:54:14
I really don't know what to say after all your tickings.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:54:19
Because I have just been writing my novel.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:54:25
researching about how people seek certainty.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:54:29
Um, attending a workshop.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:54:32
to which now I have a session, so I will have to leave early.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:54:37
Ingrid, I am observing Akira Sync.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:54:41
If people doesn't have curiosity, even if they are adults,

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:54:45
willingly, uh…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:54:49
Engage in a workshop.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:54:50
they say they are interested in learning something,

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:54:54
But in the end, when… in the community side, I post, uh…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:00
Some questions, or some things to trigger conversations?

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:06
Nobody responds.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:10
Anas…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:12
A former, uh…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:15
what's the name? Because sometimes…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:18
I… I have been designing courses for…

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:22
companies and everything. So,

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:24
For me, it's incredible how

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:27
Kudosity is dropping in our gold.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:30
So this is one of the things I'm also, like, taking notes about and trying to understand.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:37
But I'm not as engaged as you are in all those great things and experiences.

[Victoria (Spain)] 08:55:46
So that's my little check-in.

[Stacey Druss] 08:55:53
Can I… can I use my check-in to answer Victoria?

[Stacey Druss] 08:55:57
Since I didn't check in.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:55:57
No. Although Victoria's gonna drop off the call at the top of the hour, so she won't hear you if you do it later, so yes.

[Stacey Druss] 08:55:59
I can't… okay.

[Stacey Druss] 08:56:06
Okay, thank you for rethinking.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:56:09
Yeah.

[Stacey Druss] 08:56:10
I would love to answer your question about how I approach certainty.

[Stacey Druss] 08:56:15
If you're interested.

[Stacey Druss] 08:56:17
Because I've been… I'm really clear on how I do it.

[Stacey Druss] 08:56:21
I think of every story…

[Stacey Druss] 08:56:24
as being… there's two truths and a lie in it.

[Stacey Druss] 08:56:28
So I'm always… that helps me to keep an open mind, and I'm always trying to figure out which is the lie.

[Stacey Druss] 08:56:35
So it's a constant process of, well, it could be that, or it could be this.

[Stacey Druss] 08:56:41
And that's how I keep going every step of the way.

[Stacey Druss] 08:56:44
So I just wanted to share that.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:56:48
Thanks, Stacey.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:56:51
We now return to our regular program, which is already in progress.

[Jerry Michalski] 08:56:55
And we have a couple people who haven't checked in yet.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:07
So, I'll go next.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:11
So this is sort of…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:13
Zooming way, way, way, way, way in.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:17
And zooming way, way, way out at the same time.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:21
So, at the tender age of 69 as an ADD person, my executive function is finally fully

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:29
matured. And…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:31
With that, um, I have found a…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:34
I mean, huge expansion of capacity capability.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:38
to grapple with things and play with things, and do things, and use things.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:44
Um, that, you know,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:45
were opaque and impenetrable and unusable before.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:49
Um,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:51
So, um, one of the phenomena of my daily reality up until about a week ago was…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:57:58
Um, 4 to 5 browser windows with 3 monitors.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:03
each one with 45 to 50 tabs.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:06
And, um, because on one hand,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:12
Um, that was my way of…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:16
having things up.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:18
that I didn't want to lose. Of course, when you have 250 tabs,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:23
that you can't see because they're Microsoft's small, you can't differentiate. It's not as if you can find anything that way either, but emotionally,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:32
Um, they're there. They exist.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:36
And…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:38
So, approaching your computer first thing in the morning with that.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:42
was always not fun.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:45
It was always like this overwhelming crap.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:48
Like, what do I do now?

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:50
And, um…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:54
And I was thinking about, you know,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:57
browser functionalities,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:58:59
And I saw something that sort of flashed that I hadn't really…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:03
I knew the capability had to be in there, but I didn't know

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:07
what it was called, or where to find it, and…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:09
Then, I noticed in a menu…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:12
Something called…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:15
Tab Groups.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:18
And it was like…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:20
Okay, I think… I think, um, this is my path to…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:25
emancipation, to tab emancipation. And…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:29
Um, and because of newly vested executive function, I was able to, like,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:35
opened it up and learn it and master it very, very quickly, and I was able to…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:39
take those 250 tabs and…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:42
sort and bucket them into groups, and I was able to

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:45
Then close those groups, and then I was able to close the browser windows of those groups,

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:50
And freed up my machine's resources, and all of a sudden, like, my computer…

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:55
My poor little laptop that could, that I was asking.

[Doug Breitbart] 08:59:59
you know, mini-computer demands on.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:01
was able to function again. And, like, things started to flow, and I could close all that stuff, and only have the one or two tab groups.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:11
up that were relevant in that moment to actually do work and not be in overwhelm.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:20
This is life-changing.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:24
for someone like me…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:29
And…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:33
pulling way, way, way, way, way out.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:38
Um…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:41
It goes under the heading in my…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:45
you know, working reality of…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:50
the… the most meaningful questions

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:54
for me, in terms of what am I…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:00:57
devoting my attention to what am I engaging with and why.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:02
is, uh…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:04
Um…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:06
Based on the belief that every human being

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:11
has value to add and contribute.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:18
And…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:20
the only meaningful operative question inquiry.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:24
If you buy that,

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:26
is…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:28
What do each one of those individuals need in order to

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:34
be enabled to contribute.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:38
And then the third and closing inquiry is,

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:42
Based on that…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:45
How do we meet everyone's needs?

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:52
And pretty much,

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:55
everything else.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:01:57
If it is not germane to…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:00
those inquiries is…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:02
substantially irrelevant.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:08
So that's the zooming out.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:11
So, I found what I needed.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:15
in tab groups?

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:18
It unleashed a flood tide of capacity,

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:22
organizing of

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:24
moving into action.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:27
of unleashing the hounds in all sorts of ways, and now I'm going to close with

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:31
Um, the immediate nexus that OGM represents in my world.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:37
So, what's starting to happen is I'm touching a bunch of projects that

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:42
A lot of you are familiar with, because they're

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:46
projects of OGM people, or people that have dipped in and out of here.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:50
Um, and…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:53
Um, they're starting…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:02:56
to cross-connect.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:00
Um, via individuals and conversations.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:03
they're starting to coalesce, where…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:06
you know, two completely independent projects have managed to connect, and all of a sudden they're talking.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:13
And I have awareness of the one, and I have awareness of the other, and I have awareness of how they complement.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:19
And fit into a larger context.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:22
And, um…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:26
I'd say 60% of them… there's a list of about 12.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:30
60% of them all have OGM in common.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:34
So, Jerry… a hat tip.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:39
Um, for…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:41
being, you know, the energetic center of gravity,

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:45
out of which, uh, a lot of these things, uh, for me,

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:52
Uh, we're connected with and met, and…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:56
now coalesceable.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:03:58
in some fashion that I have yet to…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:04:01
Though completely, but that I'm working on. So, anyway, with that, I'm complete.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:04:31
Um, Rick, I don't know if you're just listening in, or if you want to step in.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:04:35
Um…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:04:37
But I don't want to hold up our transition to conversation.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:04:42
So I'm gonna pause a moment.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:04:46
Am I missing anybody else? Did somebody else not go?

[Jerry Michalski] 09:04:49
We're all set, good. Um, there's…

[Rick Botelho] 09:04:52
Yeah, I'll pass, Jerry. Go ahead.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:04:53
Okay, thanks, Rick.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:04:57
Um, we are now officially in conversation mode.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:05:01
Excellent. Mike took that cue instantaneously.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:05:04
And put the Carnegie calendar onto the chat, which I was going to ask you to do, so

[Jerry Michalski] 09:05:09
Fabulous, thank you so much.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:05:11
And uh… anybody… we've got, like, five, uh, four hands up immediately. Okay, so Mike, you're first.

[Mike Nelson] 09:05:18
Well, I not only acted immediately, I jumped the gun.

[Mike Nelson] 09:05:22
With my hand, but uh… one of the issues I didn't raise, and this is

[Mike Nelson] 09:05:29
Weighing on… weighing on me a great deal. Um…

[Mike Nelson] 09:05:34
our library at Carnegie gets the Wall Street Journal.

[Mike Nelson] 09:05:37
I used to subscribe to it.

[Mike Nelson] 09:05:41
Um… but the fact that it's owned by Murdoch makes it morally ambiguous to…

[Mike Nelson] 09:05:48
pay, uh, support his profits.

[Mike Nelson] 09:05:50
But I do like to support the journalists, and I do try to publicize the great articles that I read.

[Mike Nelson] 09:05:58
Uh, from the hard copy that we have at our library,

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:03
every day for the last 3 weeks, there's been at least one article along the lines of, oh my god, it's an AI bubble!

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:11
And different versions on why it is.

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:15
Uh, it's been clear to me for at least 2 years that we're on this track. It's so reminiscent of…

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:21
what happened with, uh, Time Warner being bought by AOL.

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:27
I mean, OpenAI is the AOL of our day,

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:30
has a completely overinflated

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:32
stock price, and…

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:34
Altman's doing exactly the right thing and using it to buy all sorts of

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:40
do all sorts of deals.

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:43
Which are going to not look very good in a year or two.

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:46
But…

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:48
this bubble is…

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:51
going to deflate, either…

[Mike Nelson] 09:06:55
in a few weeks, or in a few years, it's clear we're not going to maintain the kind of growth that we've seen from NVIDIA.

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:02
And some of these other companies.

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:05
Um, and the questions I have…

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:08
for anybody here who has

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:10
the courage to give financial advice.

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:14
is it going to drag down just the AI-related companies?

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:18
Or is it going to drag down the entire tech sector?

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:22
Or is it gonna drag down the entire market? One of the articles in the Wall Street Journal was,

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:29
the U.S. economy is now AI.

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:32
It made the point that all of the growth that we've seen in more than

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:37
12 months.

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:39
is because of all the investment that's going into these data centers. I mean, if you just take that out,

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:46
the economy's been flat.

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:48
And Trump is doing everything he can to make it go down. Um, so, my question…

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:55
Because I was very lucky, I

[Mike Nelson] 09:07:58
was employee number 130.

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:01
at Cloudflare, before it went IPO,

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:04
a good chunk of my retirement portfolio is still in Cloudflare stock.

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:09
And other parts of my portfolio are in

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:13
IBM stock. And other tech companies.

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:17
Because I tend to invest in what I know.

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:20
So I'm just curious, I mean, how many of you are thinking of

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:24
pulling out the profits.

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:26
From your tech investments.

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:30
That's an easy question.

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:34
And if you are, what in the hell do you put the…

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:38
Proceeds into. I mean, I… I just…

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:43
I have no clue what a good strategy here is. I mean, the reason…

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:47
Gold is up by a factor of 3, as a lot of other people are confused, too, when they figure, well, okay, I'll put it in something that will somehow have value someday.

[Mike Nelson] 09:08:57
We've never… I don't… I don't remember a discussion like this, and maybe that's because people don't like to talk finances, and…

[Mike Nelson] 09:09:03
people have… or because people have very good financial advisors.

[Mike Nelson] 09:09:07
I have a very good financial advisor, but…

[Mike Nelson] 09:09:11
you know, he… and he's got, you know, some suggestions, but I'm just curious how many of you are…

[Mike Nelson] 09:09:17
thinking of strategies for the upcoming bubble.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:09:23
Thanks, Mike. And we're not a financially-oriented group, or that necessarily expert in this. There's probably different depths of expertise in the group on that.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:09:31
But it might make a good topic for a call, like, is there a bubble? What is the bubble?

[Jerry Michalski] 09:09:35
And… I haven't had a chance to read all the too many articles about, oh my god, there's a bubble.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:09:41
But a couple of them are trying to unpack

[Jerry Michalski] 09:09:44
There could be several different bubbles going on, and here's how they

[Jerry Michalski] 09:09:48
fit and relate, which I find really fascinating, because

[Jerry Michalski] 09:09:51
I think there's clearly a bubble in a piece of it. There's, like, this frenzy to do AGI.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:09:56
But there's other parts that are not so bubbly, and I don't know, it's a really good, juicy, complex issue.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:10:01
And I haven't even addressed the, you know, do you divest all tech

[Jerry Michalski] 09:10:07
The problem with previous bubbles is

[Jerry Michalski] 09:10:11
If you heated the first warnings of, oh my god, we're in a bubble, you would miss the actual big run-up.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:10:16
Um, and you would sell too early.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:10:18
And then if you miss the fall, because usually it's the first couple people who get off the merry-go-round who profit a lot, then you lose everything. So timing is everything in these things.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:10:29
And it's a little nutty, so…

[Mike Nelson] 09:10:31
Yeah, well, this was a… this was meant to be a 2-minute discussion.

[Mike Nelson] 09:10:35
And it really is kind of, you know, put your hand up if you think there is a bubble.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:10:35
Yeah.

[Mike Nelson] 09:10:39
And then put your other hand up if you're gonna try to

[Mike Nelson] 09:10:43
dramatically reduce your exposure in the tech… not dramatically, but significantly reduce your exposure in the tech sector.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:10:47
Yeah.

[Mike Nelson] 09:10:51
And if you have a one-sentence answer to where would you put your money, you can put that in the chat.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:10:52
Let's do that.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:10:57
Let's do that. Raise your hand if you think there's a bubble.

[Mike Nelson] 09:11:01
I think there's 3 bubbles. There's one in cloud computing, one in AI chips, and then

[Mike Nelson] 09:11:07
One in cryptocurrency, which is…

[Mike Nelson] 09:11:09
that's a whole other topic.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:11
Cool. And then raise your hand if you're seriously thinking about disinvesting, changing your investment strategy.

[Mike Nelson] 09:11:20
Oh, okay, three and a half.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:20
Cool, that's… that's right.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:22
That's…

[Mike Nelson] 09:11:22
That's… that's… thank you, that's very helpful for…

[Mike Nelson] 09:11:25
Reducing my anxiety a little bit.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:28
And it's a great question, Mike, thank you.

[Mike Nelson] 09:11:30
And is pork bellies the place I should put all my money?

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:33
No, try rye coins. I put a Wikipedia link in the chat. It's the big stones they used to use, uh…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:41
as currency, I think you need to find one of those and, like, roll it around the living room as your asset.

[Mike Nelson] 09:11:45
I thought that was the island of Yap.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:47
Uh, that could well be.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:11:47
plastics, it's the future.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:50
Yeah.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:11:50
There's… there's also… there…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:11:50
Oh, wait.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:11:53
That… that is the Island of the yacht.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:11:55
There's also the guy, Mike, behind the big short in the real estate crash.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:12:00
who has a fund, who is, uh, set up to short

[Doug Breitbart] 09:12:05
The tech sector. Like, just, if you want to go straight Contra.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:09
Yep.

[Mike Nelson] 09:12:09
Okay.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:12:10
like, he'd be happy to take your money.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:12
Is it Michael Burry, or…? Yeah.

[Mike Nelson] 09:12:12
Yeah, Michael Burry, and if you haven't seen

[Doug Breitbart] 09:12:14
Yeah, yeah.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:15
That is some shit, wow. Okay, so he's…

[Mike Nelson] 09:12:16
If you haven't seen the interview,

[Doug Breitbart] 09:12:17
Yeah. He's back!

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:20
Wow!

[Mike Nelson] 09:12:20
If you haven't seen the interview with the CEO of Palantir,

[Mike Nelson] 09:12:24
Karp was interviewed about the fact that Burry had shorted Palantir.

[Mike Nelson] 09:12:28
a lot.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:12:30
and NVIDIA.

[Mike Nelson] 09:12:30
He looked panicked. He's like, oh, this is really bad. Oh, this is not fair, oh…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:37
Wow.

[Mike Nelson] 09:12:37
And his stock price went down 12%, so…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:40
I've got…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:12:40
Deer… deer in the headlights.

[Mike Nelson] 09:12:42
Sorry.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:42
So I… so… so I've got a New Yorker article, uh, that's titled, Michael Burry, Real-Life Market Genius from the Big Short.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:49
thinks another financial crisis is looming, dated,

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:52
2016.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:55
So he would have missed… he would have missed a decade of run-up.

[Mike Nelson] 09:12:58
Yep.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:12:59
And I don't know when you run out of money from shorting, but you do at some point.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:13:05
Um, that was part of the problem with the Big Short. I… and by the way, the Big Short movie and book are among my favorite

[Jerry Michalski] 09:13:11
bits of media like that. They're just so insightful.

[Mike Nelson] 09:13:14
Yep.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:13:15
Uh, Gil, Gil, please.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:13:17
And the guy who wrote the big short has done a series of books of similar depth and insight, really terrific. Michael somebody?

[Mike Nelson] 09:13:23
Michael Lewis is brilliant.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:13:23
Michael Lewis.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:13:23
Listen, Michael, this lives here in Berkeley.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:13:26
Nicholas?

[Mike Nelson] 09:13:27
He did Moneyball as well.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:13:28
Um, Moneyball and a bunch of things, yeah, brilliant, brilliant guy.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:13:32
I just first want to say, what a fine bunch of humans you all are. There's been a fascinating call just listening to the quick summaries from everybody.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:13:41
Um, couple things, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:13:43
Mike, I think I heard you say that when to get out is obvious, and obviously it's not obvious.

[Mike Nelson] 09:13:48
Oh, I didn't say that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:13:49
For the reason that Jerry said, because bubbles and FOMO are the kind of similar phenomenon.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:13:54
You know, I mean, how can tech go higher, but you can't miss out on it going higher? Same with gold, same with Bitcoin. There's this weird psychological thing in there.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:14:02
Um, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:14:04
golly, a couple of pieces here I want to tie together.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:14:08
Um,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:14:10
I've mentioned Ben Hunt before from Epsilon Theory. He's now launched a new site called Panoptica.ai, which I encourage people to take a look at.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:14:18
Um, Ben and his partner Rusty Gwynn have been tracking narratives globally. They've built AIs that scan, I don't know, 8… Alex, this is to your point, about media scans.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:14:28
Scanning 8,000 sites around the world on a regular basis, and distilling the trends of what's being talked about. So they have multicolored, complex graphs showing the rise and fall.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:14:41
of conversations about things like bubbles, or bubbles in this or that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:14:44
recession, interest rates, and so forth. It's a fascinating meta-view.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:14:48
on the stories that power the world. Ben also runs an asset management company called Second Foundation Partners. He is a confessed longtime short.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:15:01
Uh, shorted the real estate bubble back in 2008, and uh… so, you know, can somebody be a short for a long time? Maybe so.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:15:09
The Panoptica site also has got a wealth of articles and analysis and so forth. It's really fascinating stuff, much of it very OGM-y, so…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:15:18
Have a look at that. Um, on the, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:15:24
On the filters in the new scan, just to note that not just Panoptica, but our very own Marshall Kirkpatrick has been building a system that does that, focused around sustainability and regeneration.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:15:34
Uh, doing scans of trends, building products for companies around that, some very interesting stuff in the workbench there.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:15:42
Um, Marshall's rarely on these calls, but he's up to some interesting stuff.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:15:46
on that. And, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:15:49
The other thing I want to say about AI is that I was, uh, spent Tuesday at Capgemini, the French, uh,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:15:55
consultancy have been working with them on their net positive.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:15:58
Excuse me, net positive projects, which the company appears to have made a major commitment to.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:05
We've just gone through the second year.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:07
of training each year, like a cohort of 100 Hispanic-orient… Hispanic background, um, managers and executives in sustainability and net positive. Fascinating process.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:19
Um, um, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:21
planting seeds in…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:23
hundreds of companies about that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:25
But Tuesday, we had a presentation from a guy named Andres Sjoborn,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:29
Uh, who was, I think, their lead, or one of their leads on AI, and it was a fascinating hour-long overview.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:36
of the field and how he sees it, and the kind of integrations that companies are doing.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:42
Uh, in applications of AI. I've asked him for the slides, I don't know if they're publicly available. If I do get them, I'll share them here.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:48
Um, but might be somebody to track.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:51
And, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:16:56
One other thing here, um, two other things here. Um, David, uh, really intrigued to hear your discussion about growth and where… and your evolution around the conversation that you're in.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:17:08
You and I have intersected on a little bit of, and I'd love to talk with you more about that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:17:13
Um, because I think as we go into… when we look at the biological roots of the world that we live in,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:17:23
A lot of our human stories don't hold up very well.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:17:25
I'll just leave it at that for now and talk more about that another time.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:17:29
Even… well, I'll say one other thing. Even, like, our current…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:17:33
widespread irateness about what we call corruption.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:17:37
Which maybe is not that different from predator-prey relationships and parasite relationships, and the things that living systems do, just as kind of

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:17:45
part of the game. You know, there's a striving for advantage, and there's a countervailing.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:17:50
Opposition to the advantage, and that may just be what it is. And so, not to say we shouldn't resist corruption,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:17:56
But we maybe should not be quite as surprised.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:00
and outraged, and hopeful of a world without it.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:05
Um, given that. And the other thing I just wanted to comment on, from the top of the call, Scott, I was fascinated by what you talked about.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:11
Um, about the, um, you know, Kevin McLeod and being the most widespread is… do we lose Scott?

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:18
Oh, gosh, too bad.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:18:20
No, Scott's still on the call. He's muted and no video, but I think he's listening.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:21
Okay.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:23
He's hidden… I'm not seeing the video, okay.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:18:25
Yep.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:25
So, um, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:28
It just echoed for me the line from whoever it was, somebody here knows about it's amazing what you can get done if you're not concerned with getting credit for it.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:18:35
Yep.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:36
And so I was thinking about… about…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:39
Kevin McLeod and Scott and Scott's deck and other decks that I've seen other people do, and the thought about, you know, revolutionary Legos.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:50
like, building… building the pieces of the puzzle and just…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:53
throwing them out there in a way where they self-propagate, like, apparently, Kevin McLeod's been able to do.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:18:59
Rather than trying to build complete strategies, but to feed the development of multiple strategies around the world. It's just an intriguing idea.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:19:08
Um, that resonated very powerfully from what Scott said. So, Scott, thank you for that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:19:13
And I'll be chewing on that for a while, I'm complete.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:19:16
Thank you, that was a bunch of stuff. Pause, please.

[Klaus Mager] 09:19:22
Yeah, I mean, it's also AI-related, but I'm… I've been running into

[Klaus Mager] 09:19:28
a really interesting phenomena, where…

[Klaus Mager] 09:19:30
If we part of the economy is working to integrate AI into their flow,

[Klaus Mager] 09:19:37
But when you are talking with NGOs, and uh…

[Klaus Mager] 09:19:43
Uh, you know, particularly in my food and agriculture space,

[Klaus Mager] 09:19:48
Okay, it's almost an emotional rejection of wanting to deal with AI.

[Klaus Mager] 09:19:55
And the reasons given is it uses too much electricity, is the first thing you hear, it uses water.

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:01
Um, but there is the… there has been… and I'm now thinking,

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:06
you know, how can something like this penetrate so effectively into an entire sector?

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:13
Yeah, because the, the, uh…

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:16
the… this… these opinions are being held

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:19
pretty universally, and it disempowers non-profit groups.

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:24
from engaging with this technology,

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:27
Which is so powerful.

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:29
You know, I mean, I can do a search, I mean, uh, Dava just, uh,

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:34
asked a question about the Bill Gates Foundation. It took me, like, 5 seconds to find this.

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:38
Not because my AI is customized into

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:43
into these particular topics.

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:45
So we now have a relationship with the Schumacher Institute and George Pooh,

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:51
is taking it on,

[Klaus Mager] 09:20:54
to work with the open food, uh, the open global food system. It's a non-profit group, operates in 20 countries.

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:02
And they're working with food hubs now, and they're in this small CSA farmer's markets,

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:09
type of environment, and we are going to track them into the AI world.

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:15
Um, and, uh, there's two objectives. One is to get them into wholesale markets,

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:20
And the other one is to get farmers paid

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:22
for environmental services.

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:24
You know, and I already know it can be done. I mean, I've done the basic research.

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:29
with the AI to figure this out.

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:32
And here in Oregon, the Oregon…

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:36
community foundation, which is a $20 billion foundation,

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:39
has also agreed to work with me, and so I have a meeting next week where

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:45
the director, uh, you know, wants to…

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:49
set up a conversation with a catering organization, the hospital co-

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:54
catering director, and see how could we do this. And so it's just to…

[Klaus Mager] 09:21:59
to make this, you know, incredible technology available,

[Klaus Mager] 09:22:03
You know, to support these industries.

[Klaus Mager] 09:22:07
And to build a bridge. I mean, you really have to see yourself as a translation service.

[Klaus Mager] 09:22:12
You know, because all the knowledge is already out there,

[Klaus Mager] 09:22:16
But to track these groups in. And I must say, the effectiveness

[Klaus Mager] 09:22:22
with which NGOs have been neutralized from using AI and working with it.

[Klaus Mager] 09:22:28
It's just stunning. You know, I don't know who came up with this idea,

[Klaus Mager] 09:22:32
of, uh, of, uh, emphasizing this discussion around, uh,

[Klaus Mager] 09:22:38
Don't use it, it's bad for the environment.

[Klaus Mager] 09:22:41
Uh, but it sure worked, and it's taking…

[Klaus Mager] 09:22:44
a lot of effort to overcome that rejection.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:22:51
Thanks, Klaus. Uh, Rick, please.

[Rick Botelho] 09:22:55
maybe bounce off of that, because I've had conversations with academics who have this, uh, anti-AI mindset.

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:02
Um, for the environmental, et cetera, et cetera reasons, and I just had one with a colleague of mine who's a…

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:08
a professor of global studies at UNC.

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:10
about this very issue. He talked about that last… our last breakfast coffee meeting.

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:15
Um, and one of the things I'm… I'm…

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:18
Um, absolutely fascinated with, and I'm trying to develop my own skills.

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:22
is the whole notion of co-intelligence.

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:24
Not just from an individual level, but from a collective perspective, which, you know, touches on Klaus's point.

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:31
Because what you're able to do and achieve

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:34
is mind-blowing. I'm just blown away by what you can do.

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:38
Um, but what I've been working on for some time, and I've dropped it here and there in different places,

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:45
is trying… and I mentioned this phrase before, and I remember Mike saying, keep it simple.

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:50
Uh, about, uh, HAN, which is, you know, humanist-guided.

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:55
AI-enabled.

[Rick Botelho] 09:23:58
Emancipatory neoloney. And I've made some little vignettes

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:03
explaining that, what Hen means.

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:04
And, you know, we live in this incredible culture of indoctrination.

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:10
And it's so pervasive.

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:12
that, uh, the point that you put in your little chat there, Mike, about curiosity, I mean, to me,

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:18
Curiosity is the most fundamental skill

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:21
An inquiry skills.

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:23
that we need to have to be able to, um, mitigate against

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:28
the pervasive forces of neoliberalism, reductionist,

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:31
indoctrination yard.

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:34
And I'll just share something, which is…

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:36
Still a work in progress, um, and it's about how to create

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:41
emancipatory learning communities, and developing learning assets

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:45
that stimulates people's curiosities and inquiries to ask even better questions and more complex questions.

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:51
or compound questions, I should say.

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:53
And that's the beauty about AI, is that you can… I mean, it, you know…

[Rick Botelho] 09:24:58
We have a reductionist mindset to questioning, and we frame it, and we, whatever, well…

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:02
In a compound philosophical question, you can put everything in the kitchen sink in there and see what comes out, and then you can go back and see patterns that you would

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:08
or even come across a new concept you've never heard of before, and we've all done that sort of stuff.

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:13
And the question is, how can we create

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:16
Um, you know, an environment where people can learn how to become

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:20
open-minded, true-seeking, virtuous freethinkers, so that we can mitigate against all the propaganda that we're

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:26
bombarded with on a regular basis. Anyway, I'll share something in the chat.

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:30
For those who are curious about it. It's still a work in progress, and I still feel like

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:34
I've got some ways to go in terms of how to create learning communities around this.

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:38
Which are, um…

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:40
designed to be more, uh, group-centered.

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:44
And based on principles of sociocracy and whatever. So I'll put it in the chat, so…

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:50
Um, I just think the opportunities for co-intelligence is just…

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:55
you know, Cloudside, I concur with you.

[Rick Botelho] 09:25:58
Let's up our skills. How can we… how can we learn from each other more effectively about how to do that, so…

[Rick Botelho] 09:26:04
Thanks.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:26:06
Thanks, Rick. Uh, Alex.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:26:11
Right, Mike, I'll make it easy for you, for your investment conundrum.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:26:16
And it goes like this. I'm the world's worst

[Alex Kladitis] 09:26:19
possible investor. I have always…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:26:22
sold when I should have bought, and…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:26:25
bought what I should have sold.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:26:27
So, a few years back, and quite a few years back, I made the really great decision to keep 40% of my money in cash.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:26:35
Pure cash, because obviously the market's gonna crash.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:26:39
And it's still there. And I haven't yet bought into the market.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:26:44
But as soon as I'm tempted and I buy the market…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:26:47
I will actually let all of you know that I've done it, because that is a time to get out of it.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:26:53
But so far, I have not done that.

[Mike Nelson] 09:26:56
But the critical question is, is it…

[Mike Nelson] 09:26:59
cash in dollars, or cash in Swiss francs?

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:04
It's cash… it's cash that's losing its value wherever you are.

[Mike Nelson] 09:27:09
Except… except if you'd put it in Swiss francs, we were just in Switz…

[Mike Nelson] 09:27:12
Yeah. Well, thank you, Alex. This is what… the reason I ask is I am in the same category you are. I have…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:12
Except, yes, no, I didn't put it there. I didn't put it there.

[Mike Nelson] 09:27:20
You know, I have sold… sold shares that, you know, went on to increase in value by a factor of 6.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:24
Yeah.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:26
As if you're not my stories behind that, but so… so that was… I just wanted to point that out.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:31
The other thing is, Pete, I'm interested in the sheath methodology.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:35
I'd love to get in touch with you.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:38
And one more, someone said something… oh, and Doug, a long time ago, a year ago, we spoke about a game you wanted?

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:46
Do you remember that conversation?

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:48
Let's touch… let's get together, because…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:51
I can show you how to do it yourself.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:53
Given all these AI things that we've spoken about.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:27:57
You won't even have to… you don't even need me, just… I just need to show you.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:28:00
But Pete Cannon, everybody can, really.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:28:04
That's it. Thank you.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:28:05
Would love… would love, would love that,

[Jerry Michalski] 09:28:08
Cool, cool, cool. Um…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:28:10
Thank you much, Pete.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:28:13
Real quick, I put some of it in the chat, and I feel like I didn't express it very well, but…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:28:18
Mike, your question is really interesting, um, about whether we're in a bubble. I think we've been in a bubble since about the PC era, more or less. I don't… it's one big tech bubble inflation thing going on.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:28:29
It goes up and down, but the whole thing is going big and changing the world, and changing us.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:28:36
Um, AI feels like some kind of endgame.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:28:39
Um, either it's gonna usher in, you know, amazing productivity and social justice, and everything's gonna be wonderful, or…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:28:46
The whole thing's gonna crash hard, because we've turned all… all matter into GPUs, or something, right? I think what's really going to happen is some weird thing in the middle,

[Pete Kaminski] 09:28:58
But it feels…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:29:00
it's hard to say this out loud to professional people who care, but it feels like we're kind of

[Pete Kaminski] 09:29:06
post, you know, what do I do with the market? Do I do cash? Do I do gold? Do I do Bitcoin? You know, all of that.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:29:13
All of that seems like the wrong questions at this point. So, when we said, are we in a bubble, and I go like this, it's like,

[Pete Kaminski] 09:29:20
We're… we're past…

[Pete Kaminski] 09:29:22
where we've ever even thought about bubbles, where they go. You know, it's… we're in weird territory here.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:29:28
So, I think that's kind of what to… what to discuss.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:29:33
We're sort of in too-big-to-fail territory, and I've seen a couple articles there, too.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:29:38
Which is, like, this has eaten so much of the economy that…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:29:41
This is called the government foot, or something like that?

[Jerry Michalski] 09:29:44
Where you get to a scale where you can just keep

[Jerry Michalski] 09:29:48
Plowing ahead confidently because the government's gonna backstop you somehow.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:29:52
And now… and now we put AI instead of, you know, AI is going to backstop you. Will it? Won't it?

[Jerry Michalski] 09:29:52
And you'll wind up okay.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:29:58
Hmm.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:29:58
Um, uh, maybe that will be great, but we won't be able to eat, because, as Klaus has told us, you know, um, we're… we're

[Pete Kaminski] 09:30:06
we need to figure out fast how to apply AI to actually growing things and delivering food.

[Pete Kaminski] 09:30:12
And making soil regenerative, and all that stuff. So, it's a weird place.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:30:17
Absolutely. Um, thank you.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:30:21
Jill, you may have the last word. Actually, no, Doug's gonna have the last word, so go ahead, Gil.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:30:24
Okay. Well, let me try to be fast so there's room for Doug. So, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:30:28
Golly, so… I had a thing to say, but Pete, what you said, it's not like we need AI to figure out how to grow food regeneratively, we actually know how to do that.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:30:36
And many of our problems are not technology problems, they're social organization and ownership problems.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:30:42
Um, but that's a conversation for another time.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:30:46
Um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:30:48
AI and bubbles, I mean, it's not one big bubble, it's a series of bubbles. Some of them have stabilized, some of them have not.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:30:55
Um, the backstopping, uh, you know, in 2008, the government bailed out some of the banks and not others.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:02
Um, this is the whole too-big-to-fail game, and we were in another one of those now.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:05
Jerry, to your point, the numbers I hear from Ben Hunt are that, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:10
The tech sector, which is about 5% of GDP,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:14
is now pouring more money into the economy than the consumer sector, which is about 30% of the GDP.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:19
And that's the only thing keeping the economy afloat at this point.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:23
And so, yeah, will something…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:24
And masking the effects of tariffs, or whatever else might be happening is totally swamping all that other stuff.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:29
For the moment, and so… and so that's a… that's, you know, somebody's on a pump.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:33
Pumping that bubble to keep that afloat. There's that.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:31:33
Yeah.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:36
Um, um, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:38
on the data center, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:41
footprint question, which you've talked about a bunch before.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:44
Uh, it's not just turning AI to solve the problems of agriculture, we're turning AI to design the data centers of the future, and it turns out that Microsoft has been doing that over the last

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:31:52
8 years or so. There's a book out just now by Joanne Garbin called, um, Innovation at Microsoft. She led the Data Center of the Future project.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:00
And they've designed data centers that are net-zero energy and net-zero water.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:32:04
Hmm.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:05
Are they building them? Doesn't seem to be, and I don't know if anybody is yet, but at least there's that as a theoretical possibility.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:11
Not just for data centers, but potentially for everything, if we chose to go that way.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:16
But again, it's not, can we do it technically, it's will we do it?

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:20
politically, economically, financially, and so forth.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:22
Um, last, back to Mike's question about where do I move the money if I'm taking it out of Tech and Golden Bitcoin and so forth?

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:29
Uh, my financial advisor and just about every smart financial… well, who I'm calling a smart financial advisor, if I've spoken to,

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:37
says, find your asset allocation strategy and stay there.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:41
And I periodically go back to my guy and say, well, like, shouldn't we be moving some money here? He says, no.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:47
No, just allocate and stay there and rebalance periodically, and that's the way that you move tech profits into other sectors.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:54
Um, the one place where I'm disagreeing with him, I think, is that, um…

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:32:59
Um, I think we should be much more offshore.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:33:02
than we are now. Um, you know, diversify out of the United States into international much more than we are now, just because of the instability of here.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:33:11
So that's, you know, that's how I'm thinking about it.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:33:16
You bet the scoop's got nothing to say.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:33:18
I just… I just… I just drove Mike off the screen by saying that, oh my god.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:33:21
No, no, no, uh, Doug, your hand is down, but that might have been accidental.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:33:24
Period.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:33:28
I… I just… I just wanted to throw in…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:33:31
And this is empirical.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:33:35
with the rate at which…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:33:37
Energy, technology, battery technology…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:33:39
Quantum computing and the rest are…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:33:42
progressing.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:33:45
these massive billion-dollar data center

[Doug Breitbart] 09:33:50
investments.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:33:52
are obsolete in 18 months.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:33:56
How does it make sense?

[Doug Breitbart] 09:33:59
Like, just on a intuitive, logical level,

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:04
it doesn't make sense.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:06
it's gotta blow up.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:09
You know, when it's too good to be true, it just doesn't… it defies reality.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:15
And when…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:19
the biggest players in the world are…

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:22
canning $30,000, $40,000, 50,000 people.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:25
to divert resource to constructing data centers.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:30
That's the end. That's not the beginning of the end. That's not a bubble.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:34
That's the end of whatever this has been.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:37
It's sort of reached its insane

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:40
logical conclusion.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:43
as a… as a capitalist.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:45
you know, train run amok.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:34:48
But we only need $7 trillion so we can push right through that little eye of the needle and get into the singularity. Don't you want that?

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:48
So,

[Doug Breitbart] 09:34:55
So, so, yeah, I don't… I don't know what's after that, but I do know what's ending.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:35:02
Thank God.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:35:04
Like, it needed to go away.

[Doug Breitbart] 09:35:07
we need to do us differently and better if we're not going to go extinct.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:35:12
this conversation… this conversation does not want to go extinct either. Go ahead, Alex.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:13
Jerry, can I just come…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:16
Sorry, Doug mentioned a couple of things, it was really interesting.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:20
So, I was…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:22
in the throes of the, um…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:26
blockchain…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:28
temperature 2015 or thereabouts. NVIDIA shares skyrocketed because they were making the cars that were being used by the…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:35
the people that were mining Bitcoin and all the good things.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:39
And the prices went up.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:41
But what actually happened, Doug, and this is interesting what you said.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:45
is that the technology was moving so quickly that the cards, the graphics cards they were producing,

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:51
became obsolete, exactly as you said.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:53
Within 18 months. So what happened, there was a backwash in the market.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:35:58
very good cards,

[Alex Kladitis] 09:36:00
which were useful for games. So there was a second-hand market whilst they were building the latest ones.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:36:06
So, so it's just reminded me of this situation where…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:36:10
all these data centers that have become obsolete, maybe that can…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:36:14
that will produce cheap,

[Alex Kladitis] 09:36:18
alternative computing power for something.

[Alex Kladitis] 09:36:21
what does something is, I have no idea, but I just thought I'd…

[Alex Kladitis] 09:36:24
mention it.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:36:27
Thank you very much.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:36:30
Okay, let's take a deep breath.

[Jerry Michalski] 09:36:32
And then, uh, we can close out this call. We have several different topics proposed for future calls, really juicy ones, so…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:36:40
I'll pick from among those, and uh…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:36:44
Alright, thank you very much. This has been…

[Jerry Michalski] 09:36:47
Delightful.

[Gil Friend • Sustainability OG • CxO Coach] 09:36:48
Yep
