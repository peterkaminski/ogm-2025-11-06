# Human-AI Collaboration

> **Note**: Emerging theme from [[Pete Kaminski]]'s work with [[Claude Code]] and [[Field of Sheaves]] during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## The New Paradigm

Not human OR AI, but human AND AI working together:
- AI handles scale and organization
- Human provides direction and judgment
- Shared creation process

## Pete's Experience

Using agentic AI for:
- Software development (6-8+ months)
- Document synthesis
- Framework integration
- Knowledge organization

## The Questions

### Attribution
When work is "mostly built by AI," who created it?

### Value
What's valuable about AI-assisted synthesis?

### Role
What's the human's role? Curator? Director? Co-creator?

### Quality
How to evaluate AI-assisted work?

## Pete's Framing Challenge

Working on:
- "What is good about these things, and what is bad"
- "How do humans work with them"
- "Why is it okay that the AI has organized things"

## The Future

Pete: "Everybody's gonna be doing this kind of stuff in 18 months, 24 months"

Questions of attribution, value, and process will become universal.
