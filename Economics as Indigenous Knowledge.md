# Economics as Indigenous Knowledge

> **Note**: Reframing suggested by [[David Witzel]] during his check-in on the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## The Quote

"We should think of it [economics] as Indigenous knowledge, probably"

## The Reframe

Instead of:
- **Rejecting** traditional economics as foolish
- **Dismissing** economists
- **Starting from scratch**

Approach it as:
- **Wisdom tradition** with valuable insights
- **Local knowledge** from a particular culture
- **Partial truth** to be integrated with other traditions
- **Context-dependent** understanding

## Why This Matters

**Typical approach**: "A lot of people kind of want to just throw it away and say economists are fools"

**David's nuance**: "There's a lot of wisdom in economics, too, so I wouldn't... I don't think we should toss it away"

## Indigenous Knowledge Framework

Treating economics as indigenous knowledge means:
- **Respecting** its insights within context
- **Understanding** its assumptions and limitations
- **Integrating** with other knowledge systems
- **Not universalizing** its truths
- **Learning from** without colonizing by

## Application

How to:
- **Borrow** from traditional economics framings
- **Retrofit** regenerative notions into them
- **Integrate** living systems thinking
- **Create** hybrid understandings

## The Parallel

Just as:
- Indigenous knowledge systems have wisdom
- But aren't complete universal truths
- Need integration with other ways of knowing

So:
- Economics has wisdom
- But isn't complete universal truth
- Needs integration with living systems thinking
