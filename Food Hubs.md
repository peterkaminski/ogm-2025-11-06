# Food Hubs

> **Note**: Part of [[Klaus Mager]]'s [[Regenerative Agriculture]] strategy with [[Schumacher Institute]] mentioned during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## What Are Food Hubs?

Centralized facilities that:
- Aggregate products from multiple small farms
- Provide processing and storage
- Connect to wholesale markets
- Enable small farmers to access larger channels

## The Problem They Solve

**Market Access for "Agriculture of the Middle"**:
- Individual small farmers can't meet wholesale volumes
- Can't afford wholesale infrastructure
- Locked out of major markets
- Stuck at 3% of sales (farmers markets + CSAs)

## Klaus's Work Stream

Getting food hubs into wholesale markets:
- Bundling small-to-medium farmers
- Creating combined supply
- Meeting wholesale requirements
- Scaling regenerative agriculture

## Why This Matters

**Scale**:
- Moves beyond niche markets
- Reaches mainstream consumers
- Makes regenerative economically viable
- Creates market pull for change

**Farmers**:
- Access to better prices
- Reduced marketing burden
- Shared infrastructure costs
- Focus on farming
