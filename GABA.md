> **Note**: See [[GABA and Filtering]] for full treatment of this topic discussed by [[Jerry Michalski]] during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## What is GABA?

**Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid** - the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system

## Role in Consciousness Discussion

Jerry learned about GABA from Dan Brown's "The Secret of Secrets" and connected it to:
- [[Non-Local Consciousness]] theories
- [[Psilocybin and Perception]] experiences
- Filtering mechanisms in the brain
- Why psychedelics might reduce filters rather than create hallucinations

## Key Points

- High GABA = protected from overwhelm
- Low GABA = access to more perception
- Epilepsy involves GABA drops
- Psychedelics may work by reducing GABA
