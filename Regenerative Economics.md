# Regenerative Economics

> **Note**: Emerging concept connecting [[David Witzel]]'s and [[Klaus Mager]]'s thinking during the OGM 2025-11-06 call.

## The Concept

Economics that:
- Goes beyond "sustainable"
- Actively regenerates systems
- Mimics living systems
- Creates positive-sum outcomes
- Builds rather than depletes

## Examples from the Call

### Klaus's Dual Revenue Model
Farmers grow two crops:
1. Food (traditional revenue)
2. Environmental benefits (new revenue)

This:
- Incentivizes regeneration
- Makes healing profitable
- Aligns economics with ecology

### David's Growth Question
How can economic growth work like living system growth:
- Cyclical rather than endless
- Regenerative rather than extractive
- Within healthy constraints
- Building capacity for more

## Traditional vs Regenerative

**Traditional**:
- Growth = more extraction
- Efficiency = doing more with less
- Optimization within constraints
- Zero-sum competition

**Regenerative**:
- Growth = building capacity
- Efficiency = doing more with more (more health, more connection)
- Optimization for abundance
- Positive-sum collaboration

## Challenges

- How to measure regenerative value
- How to price ecosystem services
- How to shift incentive structures
- How to scale beyond niche

## David's Question

What metaphors from biological systems can inform traditional economics in new ways?

## Klaus's Answer (in practice)

Create economic incentives for regenerative behavior through:
- Payment for ecosystem services
- Measurement of environmental benefits
- Secondary revenue streams
